#Plan
After a preliminary study of DjangoCMS, this is the plan of action I suggest we follow:
- *Deciding the template*:  
  Different pages will require different templates (landing, events, tutorials).  
  The templates will be the first component to be decided.  
  *Deadline*: May 10th
- *Filling up these templates*:  
  The templates will be populated with dummy data (considering we will have to repopulate them on deployment).  
  Need for custom plugins will arise as we proceed and they will be implemented parallely.  
  *Deadline*: June 15th
- *Deployment*:  
  Considering we have a local prototype working, we will host shift our efforts on hosting.  
  Linode and WebFaction seem to be the best hosts for our site.  
  *Deadline*: July 10th
- *REST API*:  
  A REST API will be developed to allow the Robotix android app to poll event and tutorial info from the website in real time.  
  This may well extend into the next semester.
