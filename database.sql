37	32	HD	hexxa_decimal@hotmail.com		You can criticize C++ in many ways, but saying it gives bigger code than Java is bulling, not a comparison...\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/77718/why-doesnt-java-offer-operator-overloading/194889#194889\n\nAlso, when I make something in Python, it's commonly far more than 5x smaller than a Java equivalent code, or there's simply no Java equivalent I can think about due to the need of a [strongly] dynamic behavior.  The number "3-5" looks much smaller than it should be, where did you get this from?\n\n"Lisp’s lack of syntax" isn't fair. Lisp macro support allows DSLs inside itself but doesn't make it "without syntax", just gives to it a dynamic syntax. That really have no equivalent in Python, although using the AST would help. An exemple of that would be https://github.com/lihaoyi/macropy\n\nWhen talking about Java and C++ as OOP languages, Python is far more than a "glue", as its dynamic behaviour usually can't simply be written as some "paste" code in the other language, unless you're talking about a import interface such as using GTK+ in C++ with gtkmm, for which "glue" wouldn't be my choice of a word to describe.	2013-10-22 18:42:51+05:30	177.80.27.216	t	f	19	1	\N

The starting point is fairly basic : Build a manual robot which moves forward, backward, left and right according to your instruction. So, here’s what you need:\n<strong>Chassis</strong> : To use your base to make bots for manual robotics events later use 4 Wheels, 4 DC Motors, Wooden Base. If you just want a bot that can move around on plain ground, the quickest option is to break open two toy cars and use the motors along with the wheels attached)\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/dd1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-23" style="float:left;padding:10px;" title="DD" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/dd1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="178" /></a>\n\n<strong>Power Supply</strong> :  Your motors need a 12 V DC supply to run. If you are into soldering circuits yourself, you might want to make your own rectifier circuit (think back to your XIIth standard Physics textbook-Bridge Rectifier). Add an IC 7812 across the rectified output to get a stable 12 V input into your motors. Or else, just get an adaptor which gives a 12V DC output or a set of batteries.\n<strong>Control Box</strong> : This puts you in complete control of the bot. You need two switches for two motors. Now you could choose to use two three-way switches with forward, backward and stop conditions for each motor or 2 two-way switches in combination with push button switches that control the On-Off condition.\nUsually, for an autonomous robot, the front wheels are replaced by a castor wheel while the two back wheels are connected to motors.\nNow that you know all the steps, follow the schematic for guidance and build yourself your first robot!\nTo view a consolidated presentation on differential drive, click <a href="http://issuu.com/robotix/docs/dd-kraig"> here</a>	t	t	t	0	0	0	In the first issue of the new session, we dedicate a special section to all the new entrants into the robotics bandwagon as we race into what will be another glorious year of robotic achievement.

And what a welcome it was! The auditorium, one of the largest in thecampus, was filled to overflowing with eager freshmen curious to know what thissociety was all about. We are sure that all their questions would be answeredby the time we were done.\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/021.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-353" title="021" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/021-300x258.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="258" /></a>\n\nIt started off with an introduction to the societyand what we do every year. The students got to know about our workshops allacross the country, our in-house events, the projects we had helped to build,and of course, our technological extravaganza <em>ROBOTIX</em> held each January. Therewere some excellent videos and pictorials showcasing the robotics scene in Kharagpur in all its glory. It was heartening to see the interest that theaudience was taking.\n\nAfter that introduction, we moved to a slightlymore technical area, i.e. to knowing more about robotics. Aware of the factthat most of the people in the crowd did not have much of an idea about robotsother than what they had observed in popular fiction, we gave a presentationthat assumed zero prior knowledge and started right from scratch. The studentsexplored what the different parts of a robot and types of robots were, andtheir applications in various fields.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/79327907/DSC_0120.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>\nAlong with all of this, there were alsointeresting trivia questions for the spectators, with nice goodies for thosewho got them correct. One of the highlights of the show was a demonstrationusing the very powerful Microsoft Kinect, and a few volunteers from theaudience dancing on stage while playing an interactive game, with the Kinectsensing and mapping their movements. This was followed by more demonstrationsof actual robots made in Kharagpur. There was a robot that could clasp a zip-lineand move along it, a very accurate line follower, and an image processing robotwhich could follow a coloured ball as it moved around.\n\nOnce the audience had seen enough of actualrobotics to whet their appetite for learning more about it, we gave them alittle taste of the kind of work they would actually be doing very soon as theymade their first foray into the mad world of robots. There was a briefintroduction to the basics of both manual and autonomous robotics, and anoutline of what all was required to be learnt and implemented to actually makeworking robots.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/79327907/DSC_0114.JPG" alt="" width="350" height="280" /></p>\nWith that it was time to close the curtains onwhat had been a very enlightening and exciting introductory workshop.

You know what is tech cool?  Assembly line robots with laser eyes that can see where parts need to go, adjust themselves to even the slightest variations in positioning, and custom fit each placement.\n\nAn army of these new “seeing” robots has been installed at <a title="Ford.com" href="http://www.ford.com/">Ford</a>‘s Louisville Assembly Plant to install Instrument panels, windshields, roofs and fenders on the all-new Ford Escape, and they can adjust to any variations in positioning as each Escape rolls across the line to be fitted with its parts.\n\n<img class="aligncenter" src="http://dsc.discovery.com/pdi/files/2012/04/Ford-Robotics-2.jpg" alt="" width="622" height="505" />\n\nThe machines are programmed to recognize any tiny deviation from specification such as gaps between door panels or between the windshield and the vehicle body.\n\n“The ability of the machines to register any difference in each vehicle on the line improves our quality by providing a custom-like build,” said Thomas Burns, an engineer who works with the technology for the Escape. This results in things like door panels that fit tighter, reducing wind noise inside the cabin.\n\nThese new robots not only improve accuracy and deliver higher standards of build quality, but they save us humans from physical strain and injury due to repetitive motion. According to Marty Smets, an ergonomics engineer, “We also have a variety of semi-autonomous robots, which do tasks that aren’t safe for humans to do repetitively.”\n\nA robot like the Instrumentation Panel Robot (that, not surprisingly, installs the instrumentation panel), performs a task that isn’t safe for humans to do repetitively, while also improving the build quality and maximizing gap seals for that part.\n\n<img class="aligncenter" src="http://dsc.discovery.com/pdi/files/2012/04/Ford-Robotics-3.jpg" alt="" width="622" height="505" />\n\nIn the paint shop, 88 new robots reduce energy costs by more efficiently applying paint and sealer inside the body and to the exterior of the vehicle. Keeping humans out of the zones where the paint is applied reduces airflow and climate control requirements thereby saving energy and reducing carbon emissions.\n\nFord has more than 700 robots at the Louisville Assembly Plant assisting in the build of the body and interior of the all-new Escape. And as they begin to “see” and decide where to place parts, how long before humans are no longer needed on the line at all?\n\nNot that I want anyone to lose their job, but I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords.\n\nSource: <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/cars-bikes/national-robotics-week-car-building-robots-with-laser-eyes-can-see-exactly-where-to-place-parts-for-custom-like-fit.html">http://dsc.discovery.com/cars-bikes/national-robotics-week-car-building-robots-with-laser-eyes-can-see-exactly-where-to-place-parts-for-custom-like-fit.html</a>	f	f	f	0	0	0	Assembly line robots that are programmed to build cars by placing parts in exactly the same place every time are no longer tech cool.

The robot’s moving parts are protected in a carbon cage and it has carbon-fiber “legs” so that when it bumps into an obstacle, it has an active recovery system that allows the robot to bounce back up again, no matter how bad the crash. Klaptocz and his team accomplished this by fiddling with the dimensions to give it the right force to stand up again without changing the <a href="http://news.discovery.com/human/belly-buttons-sports-athletes.html">center of gravity</a>.\n\n<img class="aligncenter" src="http://dsc.discovery.com/pdi/files/2012/06/air-burr-V5-622x505.jpg" alt="" width="622" height="505" />\n\nWhile the basic engineering is the same, the robot comes in many iterations including  the “Samurai,” allowing it to return to an upright position and take off after a collision, no matter how it lands on the ground; “Sticky,” with gecko-inspired dry adhesive to attach to smooth surfaces; “Bumpy,” which has a sense of touch; and “HoverMouse,” which has a gravity-based self-recovery system to allow it to return to takeoff position after collisions.\n\nNext up for the lab: Fying robots with folding wings that can roll on the ground, using audio and sonar like bats for detecting other airborne robots.

Teams are required to build and operate a manual robot to play one-on-one football in a knockout tournament. Robosoccer combines the universal excitement and amusement inspired by football, with the thrill and satisfaction of making a working robot from scratch, so as to provide a unique and memorable experience for all the participants.\n\nTraditionally, this event has always been a crowd-puller, and a tremendous amount of fun on part of Team Robotix to organise and pull off. There is always something or the other going on while it happens. Teams gather at the venue in droves, buzzing around their robots, the making of which was a first-time experience for most of them. Meanwhile, at the arena, two teams square off, with their bots tussling over the ball and trying to both score and defend. There is cheering, heckling, congratulations and arguments, massacres and nail-biters, and so much more. Pervading all of this is a sincere enthusiasm for robotics and a healthy spirit of competition.\n\nThe problem statement in and of itself is not so complicated. It essentially amounts to building a simple differential drive, along with a kicking mechanism that depends on the creativity of the team. Moreover, all the requisite knowledge and assistance for making such a robot, is being continuously provided for the freshers, by Team Robotix, through the KRAIG classes and the hands-on sessions. Ultimately, it depends on the interest of the students to take the initiative and make something they can be proud of.\n\nSo, to come full circle, it is the need for that initiative among the first years that makes Robosoccer so special. It represents the very first steps for so many into a field that some may grow to love, not just as a hobby but as a profession. Many of the most accomplished robot designers in campus got their first taste of this tantalising field through the trials and tribulations that went in to making a robot for Robosoccer. We hope that this will always be the case every year.\n\nThe aim of Technology Robotix Society, as we have reiterated, has always been to spread the culture of robotics across as many people as possible. This event allows us to reach out to as many fresh faces as possible, in the hope that they might find something which attracts them. And we get to have so much fun while doing it. It is a win-win situation indeed.	f	f	f	0	0	0	It’s that time of the year again for the newest members of IIT Kharagpur!

The programmer need only concern himself with the appropriate usage of these tools to achieve his ends. This article deals with doing so using Java. And if you’re one of those who is not quite familiar with the language, please do have a look at <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/" target="_blank">http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/</a> Once you are comfortable with it, you can dive right into the more exciting world of NLP!\n\n<img class="alignleft" src="http://www.globalnerdy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/python-icon.jpg" alt="" width="184" height="182" />\n\nThe first step is to download the Java Natural Language Processing Toolkit called Learning Based Java (LBJ) which is freely available online from <a href="http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/download_view/11" target="_blank">http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/download_view/11</a>. It comes as a JAR file which needs to be imported into the custom libraries section of whichever IDE is there on the user’s computer for Java programming. There are several packages with several more classes, but it should not prove overwhelming. The next important step is to read the online documentation of this library, on the same site from where the downloading took place. Details of every function, in each class, in every package are given. There is actually a package called nlp and another called nlp.seg, but those are not the only ones relevant to this problem. Of course, there are similar toolkits for every major programming language, check them out at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing_toolkits" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing_toolkits</a>. The methods for implementing them will be similar to that mentioned above.\n\n<img class="alignright" src="http://l.thumbs.canstockphoto.com/canstock2980231.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="115" />\n\nArmed with all the information one could need, it is now time to attempt the problem. The sample chat log on the site, or others found online, should be saved as a .txt file. Anyone familiar with Java, or for that matter, any programming language, will know that text files can be accessed and read from with the necessary commands. Inside the program, although one’s first inclination might be to use a multi-dimensional array to store the various sentences typed in the chat log, and associate them with their authors, this author feels that such a process requires too many repeated traversals of the chat log to decide specific dimensions of the array (How many chat users, how many lines each typed .etc). A more prudent approach would be to use a recursive data structure like a linked list or a structure, and keep adding information as and when needed.\n\nThere are numerous methods one might employ to decide which anonymous statement goes to which chat participant. However, all of them will involve detailed analysis of the text in the chat log, and its meaning. It is important to remember that no code is expected to be right all the time, just enough times for it to be meaningful and not arbitrary. Manipulation of the text can be easily handled with the parse package in LBJ, while the infer package deals with trying to figure out what the sentences imply. Additional assistance can be obtained in the form of an electronic text corpus, which is an extensive list of words of the English language, as well as a freely available spell check software, in case of a random inconsistency in the chat log.\n\n<img class="alignleft" src="http://static.commentcamarche.net/en.kioskea.net/faq/images/0-uGQqwvSa-java-s-.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />\n\nAll of that, however, will come with time. For those new to this sphere, just start by installing the software and creating your own, small chat log to start with, which you can use to apply your newly-honed text analysis skills! Take each sentence individually and store it in a separate element of the data structure you have chosen. Then test out the functions of the LBJ libraries with each separate sentence and see what results you get! Now if you can incorporate results of multiple function calls on the text in a single program, you have officially completed your first concrete step on the way to NLP.\n\nWell, you now have all the tools we think you need. So gear up and start coding! And if you ever need a helping hand, feel free to post on our forum, where we have a section dedicated to the event.	t	t	t	0	0	0	Though carrying out Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the Robotix 2012 event Echelon might seem a daunting task, the tools for such are readily available online.

Let us have a look at the general picture.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">If you do much work on computers, there’s bound to be some task you’d like to manipulate and automate further. Case in point, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a bunch of photo files in a preferred manner. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game. At the same time, you don’t want to delve deep into the programmers’ realm. If that is who you are, Python might be the answer for you.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types, Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Its elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<p dir="ltr">the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</p>\n</li>\n\t<li>\n<p dir="ltr">statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</p>\n</li>\n\t<li>\n<p dir="ltr">no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nOften, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. Once you are really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension or command language for that application.\n<p dir="ltr">The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, <a href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a>, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">COMING UP : Python is often compared to other interpreted languages such as Java, JavaScript, Perl, Tcl, or Smalltalk. Comparisons to C++, Common Lisp and Scheme can also be enlightening. In coming articles, we will see briefly the comparison between Python and each of these languages.</p>\n\n</div>	t	t	t	0	0	0	Even though you are free to pick a language (and a third party NLP library written in the same) of your choice to attempt a solution to the online programming event, Echelon, at Robotix 2012, there are certain reasons we recommend Python (and Python - NLTK) to beginners.

Since these aspects are highly variable, it seems a waste of time to consider them much for this comparison.</p>\n\n<h2>Python VS Java</h2>\n<div>\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/python-vs-java-726367-copy.jpg"><img title="python-vs-java-726367 - Copy" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/python-vs-java-726367-copy.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="197" align="left" hspace="10px" vspace="10px" /></a>Python programs are generally expected to run slower than Java programs, but they also take much less time to develop. Python programs are typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java programs. This difference can be attributed to Python's built-in high-level data types and its dynamic typing. For example, a Python programmer wastes no time declaring the types of arguments or variables, and Python's powerful polymorphic list and dictionary types, for which rich syntactic support is built straight into the language, find a use in almost every Python program. Because of the run-time typing, Python's run time must work harder than Java's. For example, when evaluating the expression a+b, it must first inspect the objects a and b to find out their type, which is not known at compile time. It then invokes the appropriate addition operation, which may be an overloaded user-defined method. Java, on the other hand, can perform an efficient integer or floating point addition, but requires variable declarations for a and b, and does not allow overloading of the + operator for instances of user-defined classes.\nFor these reasons, Python is much better suited as a "glue" language, while Java is better characterized as a low-level implementation language. In fact, the two together make an excellent combination. Components can be developed in Java and combined to form applications in Python; Python can also be used to prototype components until their design can be "hardened" in a Java implementation. To support this type of development, a Python implementation written in Java is under development, which allows calling Python code from Java and vice versa. In this implementation, Python source code is translated to Java bytecode (with help from a run-time library to support Python's dynamic semantics).\n\nNext up : We tell you more about Python's stand against Javascript!\n\n</div>	t	t	t	0	0	0	In this and a series of following articles, we take you through brief comparisons between programming languages concentrate on language issues only so you can figure out which one is best for your use.

Like JavaScript (and unlike Java), Python supports a programming style that uses simple functions and variables without engaging in class definitions. However, for JavaScript, that's all there is. Python, on the other hand, supports writing much larger programs and better code reuse through a true object-oriented programming style, where classes and inheritance play an important role.\n\n<img src="http://www.siliconbeachtraining.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/python-training-php.jpg" alt="null" width="300px" height="250px" align="left" hspace="10px" vspace="10px" />Python and Perl come from a similar background (Unix scripting, which both have long outgrown), and sport many similar features, but have a different philosophy. Perl emphasizes support for common application-oriented tasks, e.g. by having built-in regular expressions, file scanning and report generating features. Python emphasizes support for common programming methodologies such as data structure design and object-oriented programming, and encourages programmers to write readable (and thus maintainable) code by providing an elegant but not overly cryptic notation. As a consequence, Python comes close to Perl but rarely beats it in its original application domain; however Python has an applicability well beyond Perl's niche.\n\nStay tuned for more as you go about choosing your own favourite coding platform.	t	t	t	0	0	0	In this not very long post, lets see how Python, Javascript and Perl compare.

It should be noted that Python has introspective capabilities similar to those of Lisp, and Python programs can construct and execute program fragments on the fly. Usually, real-world properties are decisive: Common Lisp is big (in every sense), and the Scheme world is fragmented between many incompatible versions, where Python has a single, free, compact implementation.\n\nWith that, we close the Romancing Python series.

Stalker involved two fully autonomous robots communicating with each other so that one could replicate the path of the other, on different surfaces. Nuke-Clear required the designing of a robot which could detect bombs, plan a route to them from an overhead camera, and defuse the bombs by pressing a button, all through image processing. And the online coding event, Echelon, required an adept use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), a very important concept in artificial intelligence, to determine authorship of certain lines in a chat log.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">All in all, the 4 days of ROBOTIX 2012, which was the culmination of a year-long effort on the part of the people of Technology Robotix Society, was a truly memorable and enriching experience.

The starting point is fairly basic : Build a manual robot which moves forward, backward, left and right according to your instruction. So, here’s what you need:\n\n<strong>Chassis</strong> : To use your base to make bots for manual robotics events later use 4 Wheels, 4 DC Motors, Wooden Base. If you just want a bot that can move around on plain ground, the quickest option is to break open two toy cars and use the motors along with the wheels attached)\n\n<strong> <a href="http://blog.robotix.in/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/DIY.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-115" src="http://blog.robotix.in/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/DIY-300x181.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="181" /></a></strong>\n\n<strong>Power Supply</strong> : Your motors need a 12 V DC supply to run. If you are into soldering circuits yourself, you might want to make your own rectifier circuit (think back to your XIIth standard Physics textbook-Bridge Rectifier). Add an IC 7812 across the rectified output to get a stable 12 V input into your motors.  Or else, just get an adaptor which gives a 12V DC output or a set of batteries.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHeres how to make a rectifier on a Breadboard:\n<div align="center"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JEWKufHjAUU" frameborder="0" align="center" width="420" height="345"></iframe></div>\n<strong>Control Box</strong> : This puts you in complete control of the bot.  You need two switches for two motors. Now you could choose to use two three-way switches with forward, backward and stop conditions for each motor or 2 two-way switches in combination with push button switches that control the On-Off condition.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUsually, for an autonomous robot, the front wheels are replaced by a castor wheel while the two back wheels are connected to motors.\n\nNow that you know all the steps, follow the schematic for guidance and build yourself your first robot!	t	t	t	0	0	0	In the first issue of the new session, we dedicate a special section to all the new entrants into the robotics bandwagon as we race into what will be another glorious year of robotic achievement.

Usually a robotic  arm has six degrees of freedom, is made with over seven segments of metal framework, having over six joints and as most robots are made for, are designed for repetitive heavy manufacturing work.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor those who pursue robotics as a hobby here’s an easy way to make a simplified robotic arm. You might want to give it two, three or more degrees of freedom, make it automated using simple coding or make it remote controlled or just build one for understanding the build. The robotic arm described here has five degrees of, so basically it has five different joints that enable it to move in five different ways.\n\nYou'll need:\n\n1) 4 DC Motors - their RPMs varying from 30 to higher depending on availability. Note one of the motors must be a low RPM motor that can help in gripping objects.\n\n2) Wooden planks, preferably thin ply because it is easy to work on.\n\n3) Single and multi strand wires.\n\n4) A solder iron and solder wire\n\nThe base of the arm is a disk mounted on a motor fit at its center. The arm can now move in all directions about that base. Now fit a motor to the base with its axis horizontal, this motor should have been pre fit within two planks of appropriate lengths. The other end of the two planks now hold the third motor which in turn is fit within two more shorter planks . This segment holds your gripping arm at its end.  It has the last motor fit with the four bar mechanism (and preferably the one with the least rpm). Four bar mechanism involves the use of four short rods connected as seen in the pic below.\n\n<a href="http://blog.robotix.in/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/arm1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-126" src="http://blog.robotix.in/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/arm1.jpg" alt="" width="206" height="152" /></a>           <a href="http://blog.robotix.in/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/arm2.gif"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-127" src="http://blog.robotix.in/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/arm2.gif" alt="" width="223" height="163" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow that we have made the chassis you can now move on to making better and more accurate arms using stepper motors, giving them a life of their own using micro controllers  and even make a bot that simulates your arm using image processing.

This process has its limitations though, mainly when the speed is increased.  This is when a PID controller starts to shine.\n\n<strong>PID</strong> stands for<strong> Proportional, Integral and Derivative</strong>.  A <strong>PID </strong>controller is a mathematics based procedure that processes sensor data and uses it to control the direction (and/ or speed) of a robot to keep it on course. Why does <strong>PID </strong>work better than our simple model described above? Let's talk about how robot acts (or behaves) as it follows a line to see why.\n\n<strong>Behaviour of a line follower</strong>\n\nLet's say our robot has 3 sensors- Left, Centre and Right. When the Centre sensor sees the line, the robot is programmed to go straight. When the Left (Right) sensor sees the line, the robot is programmed to turn right (left). This will typically cause the robot the wobble back and forth over the line and if going too fast, it may lose control and stop following the line altogether.\n\n<strong>Before we go into how exactly PID works, here are some terms you need to know : </strong>\n\n<strong>Error </strong>- The difference between the target position and the measured position the Error.\n\n<strong>Proportional - </strong>Measures how far your robot is away from the line.\n\n<strong>Integral </strong>- Measures the accumulated <strong>Error</strong> over time.\n\n<strong>Derivative </strong>- Measures the rate at which the robot is moving left-to-right or right-to-left.\n\nThe “Control” variable, which helps in precise motion of the bot is essentially a combination of the P, I and D elements with coefficients Kp, Kd and Ki. Thus, the input into the motors are according to the total error calculated from P, I and D values.\n\nIn order for your line follower to attain optimum performance, tuning is the most important last step to be followed :\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Kp</strong> = 1, <strong>Kd</strong> = <strong>Ki</strong> = 0. The goal is to get the robot to follow the line even if it is very wobbly</li>\n\t<li>Assign<strong> Kd</strong> = 1. Try increasing this value until you see lesser amount of wobbling</li>\n\t<li>Once the robot is fairly stable at following the line, assign a value of 0.5 to 1.0 to <strong>K</strong><sub><strong>i</strong> .</sub>Since Integral is cumulative, the <strong>K<sub>i</sub></strong> value has a significant impact. You may end up adjusting it by .01 increments.</li>\n\t<li>Once the robot is following the line with good accuracy, you can increase the speed and see if it still is able to follow the line</li>\n</ul>\nKeep in mind that you need not implement P, I and D. Only P or even PI could serve your purpose in which case don’t complicate the system further.	t	t	t	0	0	0	The simplest example to understand PID is a Line Follower, which we shall consider here.

Usually a robotic arm has six degrees of freedom, is made with over seven segments of metal framework, having over six joints and are designed for repetitive heavy manufacturing work.\nFor those who pursue robotics as a hobby here’s an easy way to make a simplified robotic arm.\n\nYou'll need thin wooden planks, wires, a solder iron and 4 DC Motors with varying RPMs. Note one of the motors must be a low RPM motor that can help in gripping objects.\n\n<table width="400px"> <tr> <td width="200px"> <a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/roboticarm_21.jpg"><img src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/roboticarm_21.jpg?w=150" alt="" title="roboticarm_2" width="150" height="120" class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-64" /></a></td> <td width="200px"> <a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/roboticarm_31.jpg"><img src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/roboticarm_31.jpg?w=150" alt="" title="roboticarm_3" width="150" height="113" class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-66" /></a></td></tr></table>\nThe base of the arm is a disk mounted on a motor fit at its center. Now fit a motor to the base with its axis horizontal. The other end of the two planks now hold the third motor which in turn is fit within two more shorter planks. This segment holds your gripping arm at its end. It has the last motor fit with the four bar mechanism (and preferably the one with the least rpm). Four bar mechanism involves the use of four short rods connected as seen in the pic below.\n\nNow that we have made the chassis you can now move on to making better and more accurate arms using servo motors and even simulate a human arm using Image Processing. We ,Team Robotix had our very own robotic arm built under the project “Michelangelo” where the arm drew graphs of functions .\n\nFind out these methods and lots more on our website www.robotix.in.	t	t	t	0	0	0	"Jacob took that coke in his hand, the Herald919, what he named his other "arm", made of tinker and junk mimicked the same.

They follow pretty simple rules like speed is directly proportional to voltage and reversing terminals mean reversing the direction of motion. As we move forward from a simple differential drive our actuator requirements also change. This post is to familiarize beginners with servos- a type of electromagnetic actuators that do not rotate continuously like DC motors rather are used to position some object .Servo Motors were extensively used in the events Ballista and The Fugitives at ROBOTIX 2011. Servos prove better then stepper motors because the employ a feedback mechanism.\nA servo has three wires coming out of it one for positive supply(red), the other for ground(black) and the last one for control (usually yellow or white).The positive wire is attached to a power supply of 4.8V to 6V. The various Hi Tech servos and their specifications are given <a href="http://www.hobbyhorse.com/servo_specs.shtml" target="_blank">here</a>.\n\nA servo motor only rotates 180 degree and has to be lobotomized if it is required to rotate continuously or to a higher angle. Here we shall talk only about non lobotomized servo.\nControlling a servo is easy by using a microcontroller; no motor driver circuit is required. Just a control signal is needed to be feed to the servo to position it in any specified angle. The frequency of the control signal is 50 Hz and the width of positive pulse controls the angle (Pulse width modulation). 20ms time period corresponds to 50HZ.\n<table width="700px">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="250px"><a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/servo_2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-72" title="servo_2" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/servo_2.png?w=" alt="" width="300" height="217" /></a></td>\n<td width="100px"></td>\n<td width="350px"><a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/servo_3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-73" title="servo_3" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/servo_3.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="217" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThe voltage is fed directly from the power supply (Rectifier circuit/adapter/battery).\nThe control signal has to be fed a PWM.

The first session covered an introduction to autonomous robotics, along with detailed instructions for making a basic line follower, including the principle behind it, the assembly, and the programming involved. This was followed by another session which had an introduction to the basics of manual robotics; the differential drive for locomotion, as well as other important mechanisms for performing certain fundamental tasks. There was ample interaction with the audience, along with an extensive clearing of relevant doubts.\n<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.9810176657047123">\n</strong>The second day saw a day-long hands-on session with the participants, where many, if not all of them, got their first taste of working with robotics accessories. The various components were displayed and explained. Each team in the autonomous workshop was given a kit for making a line follower, which had been arranged for by the organizing college. They were shown how to assemble it and were helped to do the same. Elsewhere, the teams who had made differential drives were assisted and supervised. The minor problems and issues were patiently observed and worked out by our team, so things in general moved quite smoothly.\n\nIn the afternoon, the rooms in the building where the workshop was being conducted were abuzz with the sound of robots moving about, and their makers jubilant at their success. There were 32 teams in the autonomous workshop that saw their line followers running nicely over white lines on black surfaces, while the 50 teams in the manual workshop manoeuvred their differential drives around the room. A small event was also arranged to find out which team could control their differential drive best, while steering it over inclined surfaces.\n\nThe workshop at BCET Durgapur was a resounding success, and we were privileged to be able to introduce so many students to the wonderful world of robotics. The enthusiasm of the students as well as the persistence of the organisers was very heartening to observe, and we hope they will continue to keep their passion alive.

Now, a team at the University of Leeds, UK, have borrowed a trick from nature to build a new kind of hard drive.\n\nCertain strains of bacteria absorb iron to make magnetic nanoparticles that let them navigateusing the Earth's magnetic field. The team have extracted the protein behind this process and used it to create magnetic patterns that can store data. "We're using and abusing nature because it's had billions of years to do all of its experiments through evolution, so there is almost no point in us starting from scratch," says <a href="http://www.astbury.leeds.ac.uk/people/staffpage.php?StaffID=SSS" target="nsarticle">Sarah Staniland</a>, who led the research (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.201101627/abstract" target="nsarticle"><em>Small</em>, vol 8, p  204</a>).\n\nHard drives are usually made by "sputtering", in which clouds of argon ions are fired at a sheet of magnetic material, knocking off particles which are deposited as a thin film on a disc. Groups of these particles, called grains, form the magnetic regions on the drive, with around 100 grains corresponding to one bit.\n\nInstead of granular media, Staniland's team produce bit-patterned media. They start with a gold surface coated in chemicals in a chessboard pattern so that one set of squares binds proteins and the other repels them. They then apply the magnet-producing protein and coat the surface with an iron solution, which the protein-covered squares convert into magnetic material.\n\nAs the name suggests, each magnetic square in bit-patterned media can store one bit. Each square Staniland's team have so far produced is around 20 micrometres wide, far too bulky to store data with a density comparable to today's hard drives. She says they now plan to test out nano-sized squares, 1000 times smaller and much closer to existing drive density.\n\nEventually, she hopes to create a hard drive with a single iron particle per square, which will store as much as 1 terabyte of data per square inch - far beyond the capability of most hard drives.\n\n"They've done nice work showing how you can make particles on a surface," says <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/Thomas.thomson/personaldetails" target="nsarticle">Thomas Thomson</a>, who studies data storage at the University of Manchester, UK.

For if you pay a visit to this restaurant, in downtown Harbin, China, you will find 18 robots - from a waitress to a cooker to an usher - ready to ensure your dining experience is perfect. The restaurant has 18 types of robots, each gliding out of the kitchen to provide your dish, with specialty robots including a dumpling robot and a noodle robot.\n\nWhen a diner walks in, the usher robot extends their arm to the side and, with a sci-fi flourish, says 'Earth Person, Hello, Welcome to the Robot Restaurant.'  After the diners have ordered, the robots in the kitchen set to work cooking. Once the dish is prepared, a robot waiter, which runs along tracks on the floor, carries it from kitchen to table. Prepared dishes are placed on a suspended conveyor belt and when the plate reaches the right table the mechanical arms lift it off and set it down. As they eat, a singing robot entertains diners.\n\nAll the robots in the restaurant were designed and made by the Harbin Haohai Robot Company. Chief Engineer Liu Hasheng, said they invested 5 million Yuan (about £500,000) in doing the restaurant, with each robot costing 200,000 to 300,000 Yuan (around £20,000 to £30,000).\n\nHe comments: 'Staff in the computer room can manage the whole robot team. 'After the busy times during the day, the robot will go for a "meal", which is electricity'. Liu added that after a two-hour charge the robot can work continuously for 5 hours. The restaurant now provides a menu with more than 30 dishes, and for the average cost for a diner is £4 to £5. More than a dozen robots operate in the restaurant as entertainers, servers, greeters and receptionists.	f	f	f	0	0	0	They say robots will one day serve mankind - in which case you can consider this an entrée.

As we dug into our archives, we found a treasure trove of  interesting robots that featured in this year’s edition of the fest. Without a lengthy preamble, lets head straight into technical glory!\n\nRoboCop was designed to be an event that tested a bot’s ability to identify criminals from civilians . A bot actually shot marbles using a hydraulic mechanism based on air pressure at the “criminals”.  In Pirate Bay, some robots had multiple arms for digging through sand and pebble. One even used a sweeping mechanism to traverse through sand!  A stunning bot used multiple underwater propellers with <em>Blue LEDs</em> as illumination in R.A.F.T. Yet another used air propellers instead of water propellers.\n\nThe event “The Fugitives” broke new ground with teams of no less than two bots collaborating to corner stationary “fugitives” placed in a 10X10 grid. Wireless communication was used by several participating teams to run the team of bots. Ballista needed bots to detect a moving light source and shoot balls at it which was done with perfection by several teams.\n\nHere are a few of the extraordinary designs which caught our (very observant) eye.\n\n[gallery]	t	t	t	0	0	0	Let us look back at ROBOTIX 2011 from the point of view of a robotics aficionado with a fetish for out - of – the – box solutions to even the minimum of robot tasks.

This process has its limitations though, mainly when the speed is increased.  This is when a PID controller starts to shine.\n\n<strong>PID</strong> stands for<strong> Proportional, Integral and Derivative</strong>.  A <strong>PID </strong>controller is a mathematics based procedure that processes sensor data and uses it to control the direction (and/ or speed) of a robot to keep it on course. Why does <strong>PID </strong>work better than our simple model described above? Let's talk about how robot acts (or behaves) as it follows a line to see why.\n\n<strong>Behaviour of a line follower</strong>\n\nLet's say our robot has 3 sensors- Left, Centre and Right. When the Centre sensor sees the line, the robot is programmed to go straight. When the Left (Right) sensor sees the line, the robot is programmed to turn right (left). This will typically cause the robot the wobble back and forth over the line and if going too fast, it may lose control and stop following the line altogether.\n\n<strong>Before we go into how exactly PID works, here are some terms you need to know : </strong>\n\n<strong>Error </strong>- The difference between the target position and the measured position the Error.\n\n<strong>Proportional - </strong>Measures how far your robot is away from the line.\n\n<strong>Integral </strong>- Measures the accumulated <strong>Error</strong> over time.\n\n<strong>Derivative </strong>- Measures the rate at which the robot is moving left-to-right or right-to-left.\n\nThe “Control” variable, which helps in precise motion of the bot is essentially a combination of the P, I and D elements with coefficients Kp, Kd and Ki,\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pid_1.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-88" title="PID_1" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pid_1.png?w=217" alt="" width="130" height="206" hspace="10px" /></a>\n\nIn order for your line follower to attain optimum performance, tuning is the most important last step to be followed :\n<ul>\n\t<li>Kp = 1, Kd = Ki = 0. The goal is to get the robot to follow the line even if it is very wobbly</li>\n\t<li>Assign Kd = 1. Try increasing this value until you see lesser amount of wobbling</li>\n\t<li>Once the robot is fairly stable at following the line, assign a value of 0.5 to 1.0 to K<sub>i .</sub>Since Integral is cumulative, the K<sub>i</sub> value has a significant impact. You may end up adjusting it by .01 increments.</li>\n\t<li>Once the robot is following the line with good accuracy, you can increase the speed and see if it still is able to follow the line.</li>\n</ul>\nKeep in mind that you need not implement P, I and D. Only P or even PI could serve your purpose in which case don’t complicate the system further.	t	t	t	1	0	0	At slower speeds, line following is pretty simple - if the sensors say it is going left, steer right and if going right, steer left.

The reason being evident that it is one of the most energy\nefficient and most widely tested and naturally certified designs ever\npossible. These kinds of designs for robots ensure more stability in\nall aspects and bring to advantage several latest technologies.\n\nResearchers are presently taking a step foreward in the artificial\nintelligence technology by trying to mimic the human  brain and its\nneurons to be used in robots.  Researchers from the National\nUniversity Of Ireland And The  University Of Ulster have been working\non this with the main aim of applying an electronic neural device\ncalled the Hardware Spiking Neural Network to the control and behavior\nof an autonomous robot. The present day silicon IC technology is not\ncapable of handling the complexity of the neurons found in the human\nbrain. Researchers have now successfully fabricated and used spiking\nneural networks for robotics control. In a manner similar to that of\nthe brain, the device can be trained to perform a specific function\nand also later retrained to perform some other functions.\n\nTo date, robotics technologies have concentrated on usage of\nmicroprocessors for autonomous robots. The major concern here is the\npower consumption. The awerage power consumption of the brain is about\n10watts while that of a computer is about 300 watts.\n\nThe ultimate goal of such a device is to identify and overcome\nelectronic faults that occur within itself and to adapt to its\nsurroundings without human intervention.	t	t	t	0	0	0	Biomimicry is one of the most inspiring fields around which present day robotics researches revolve.

As we have seen through the ages, dating right back to the pre-historic times, every technological advancement in human history has had an echo in the industrial development and economy of the world. Robots and in general, the whole new area of robotics has had a dynamo effect on world economics.\n\n[caption id="attachment_176" align="alignleft" width="150" caption="Industrial robot for processing food products like bread"]<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/untitledn3.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-176" title="Industrial robot for processing food products like bread" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/untitledn3.png?w=150" alt="Industrial robot for processing food products like bread" width="150" height="112" hspace="10px" /></a>[/caption]\n\nIndustrial robots are employed in almost every manufacturing plant around the world. A plant can never be efficient in production if the work force is not motivated enough to work. Solution : Use robots, they need no motivation! Chores, which are deemed boring, monotonous but mostly ardous to humans are done in split seconds by these world-changing machines.\n\n[caption id="attachment_178" align="alignright" width="150" caption="A 6 - Axis Robot"]<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/untitledn21.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-178" title="A 6 - Axis Robot" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/untitledn21.png?w=150" alt="A 6 - Axis Robot" width="150" height="138" hspace="10px" /></a>[/caption]\n\nThe development of 5 axis , 6 axis (indicating the degrees of freedom it has) and other variety of robots has led to a revolution in the tasks like welding, machining and assembly of parts which can now be done in a fraction of the time that we, prone to fatigue and mental exhaustion, humans would take.\n\nThese robots are not limited only to the manufacturing and civil industry. Mine surveillance, farming, medical treatment, defence, and underwater exploration are just a few examples of activities which are steadily becoming robot dependent.\n\n[caption id="attachment_174" align="aligncenter" width="295" caption="A mining robot - Line diagram"]<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/untitledn1.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-174" title="A mining robot - Line diagram" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/untitledn1.png?w=295" alt="A mining robot - Line diagram" width="295" height="300" /></a>[/caption]\n\nWe, at Robotix, have always tried to create problem statements which are society and industry oriented.

His segmented "Troller 1D" robot can either <a href="http://www.innovationnewsdaily.com/805-barking-dog-activates-snake-robot-rescue-mission.html">slink along like a caterpillar or snake</a> while lying flat, or roll into a large circle and move forward like the treads on a tank. The current version remains a tethered machine under direct human control, but a finalized robot design could have motion-sensing capabilities based on sensors found in gaming controllers (such as the Wii remote). That would allow the robot to learn how to roll at different speeds, change directions and transform on its own into crawling mode.\nMore advanced robots could evolve from Troller 1D's design to someday have the ability to walk like a four-legged robot — a capability based on the separate links that join together to make each robot. A "master link" would have the main controller, motion-sensing ability, wireless communication, a battery pack and servo motors.\nBaumgartner's project on the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tbaumg/troller-1d-educational-hobby-robot?ref=category">crowd-funding website Kickstarter</a> has already raised much more funding than its $2,600 goal intended to turn the robot into a reality. Anyone who pledges $1,400 can get a kit for the fully functional robot around March 2013.\nThe Troller 1D project represents just the latest hobby robot for Baumgartner — his past projects have also seen Kickstarter success and are available on his personal "Trobotown" website. Baumgartner's day job involves working with big, fast industrial factory robots capable of moving thousands of pounds.\nTransforming robots capable of moving around in different ways have also appeared as research lab projects, even if none are able to morph into a luxury car or fighter jet just yet. National Taiwan University has worked on a robot capable of changing its wheels into legs, and <a href="http://www.innovationnewsdaily.com/507-hover-drone-winged-aircraft-flexrotor.html">Aerovel's Flexrotor drone</a> can go from hovering helicopter mode to cruising like an airplane.\n\n<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.7621138256508857"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uR-nqtFyWTor49h4EMNKRQVXIpPzSEd90iCDscBZ-CaLXI4-S0lGksxSzVZ-xqfGgWUMxWDkFr4bT8uZ2OybbOUsLFgjQTEci3AeTiosZiRRyefrGR8" alt="" width="352px;" height="240px;" /></strong>	t	t	t	0	0	0	A legendary hoop snake capable of gripping its own tail and rolling like a wheel has never proven more than a myth, but a new robot could mimic the supposed creature's ability to both crawl and roll around.

In it, we were able to showcase the various domains that we are currently exploring in the field of robotics. The event was extensively publicised and covered by local newspapers, as well as mentioned in national ones like the <strong>Indian Express</strong> and the <strong>Hindustan Times</strong>, and it also received some airtime on local news channels.\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/556595_10150770092617959_1385460084_n.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-316" title="556595_10150770092617959_1385460084_n" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/556595_10150770092617959_1385460084_n-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>\n\nAutonomous robots were one of the most popular attractions for the eager audience. Some of the autonomous robots displayed were a line follower, a wall follower and a team of two robots that could communicate with each other and traverse on multiple heights.\n\nImage processing, one of our niches, in which Kharagpur has shown brilliance over the years, was also demonstrated in the form of operating robots that could autonomously plan paths, and detect objects, colours and other visual features in an arena that simulated a maze with multiple bombs which needed to be diffused.\n\nMechanical robots were also there to inspire some of the more creative people in the audience. At the exhibition, the younger kids were given the liberty to play with small custom-made toy car robots (termed differential drives which form the basic chassis for more complicated modules). One of the more advanced contraptions was a manual robot that could move on a zipline and shoot balls into containers on the ground.  Another interesting display was that of a robot that could balance an open container of water, and conserve as much of it as possible, while traversing over rough and irregular terrain.\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/405272_10150770096172959_348996349_n.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-321" title="405272_10150770096172959_348996349_n" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/405272_10150770096172959_348996349_n-300x205.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="205" /></a>\n\nFor those who do not want to get into the nitty-gritty details of mechanical design, the use of robotics kits to make simple working robots was also displayed, for their benefit. There was also a theoretical session on an introduction to manual robotics and image processing for the attending students.\n\nWe hope that the interest among the attending students and the general public will encourage more people to take up robotics as a hobby and hopefully, as a subject of research. For us, this successful event was yet another reminder of how much potential there is for this field, and of our responsibility to cultivate it.	f	f	f	0	0	0	Technology Robotix Society held a workshop-cum exhibition at the Ranchi Science Centre on 4th March, which was the first such event for Ranchi.

The Navy has also trained dolphins and sea lions to search for bombs on and around vessels. While animals can cover a large area in a short amount of time, they are costly to train and care for, and don’t always perform as expected.</p>\nIn the last few years, Navy scientists, along with research institutions around the world, have been engineering resilient robots for minesweeping and other risky underwater missions. The ultimate goal is to design completely autonomous robots that can navigate and map cloudy underwater environments — without any prior knowledge of those environments — and detect mines as small as an iPod.\n\nNow Franz Hover, the Finmeccanica Career Development Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and graduate student Brendan Englot have designed algorithms that vastly improve such robots’ navigation and feature-detecting capabilities. Using the group’s algorithms, the robot is able to swim around a ship’s hull and view complex structures such as propellers and shafts. The goal is to achieve a resolution fine enough to detect a 10-centimeter mine attached to the side of a ship.\n\n“A mine this small may not sink the vessel or cause loss of life, but if it bends the shaft, or damages the bearing, you still have a big problem,” Hover says. “The ability to ensure that the bottom of the boat doesn’t have a mine attached to it is really critical to vessel security today.”\n\nHover and his colleagues have detailed their approach in a paper to appear in the<em>International Journal of Robotics Research</em>.\n\n<strong>Seeing a shape in the dots</strong>\n\nThe engineering of such an inspection is a thorny computational problem that Hover and his group have investigated for the last decade. The researchers are coming up with algorithms to program a robot called the Hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (HAUV), originally developed as part of <a href="http://seagrant.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT’s Sea Grant</a> program. The technology has since been commercialized by spinoff <a href="http://www.bluefinrobotics.com/" target="_blank">Bluefin Robotics Corp.</a>, and the MIT engineers have continued to work to improve its performance through the years.\n\nFully viewing a massive structure such as a naval combat vessel — as well as all its small features, including bolts, struts and any small mines — is a tricky planning problem, according to Hover.\n\n“It’s not enough to just view it from a safe distance,” Hover says. “The vehicle has to go in and fly through the propellers and the rudders, trying to sweep everything, usually with short-range sensors that have a limited field of view.”\n<p style="text-align: left;">The group approached the challenge in two stages. For the first stage, the researchers programmed the robot to approach the ship’s hull from a safe 10-meter distance, swimming in a square around the structure. The vehicle’s sonar camera emits signals that boomerang back as the robot makes its way around the ship; the researchers process the sonar signals into a grainy point cloud. At such a low resolution, Hover says one can clearly make out a ship’s large propeller, though not an iPod-sized mine.</p>\n“We get an immense point cloud,” Hover says. “And believe it or not, we see the shape of the ship’s structures emerge.”\n\nHowever, Hover describes the point cloud as a “mist” that doesn’t necessarily tell a robot where a ship’s structures begin and end — crucial information for the robot to avoid colliding with a ship’s propellers. To translate this “mist” into a solid structure, the researchers adapted computer-graphics algorithms to their sonar data, generating a three-dimensional, “watertight” mesh model.\n\n<strong>Up close and mine-able</strong>\n\nFor the second stage of their approach, the researchers programmed the robot to swim closer to the ship, navigating around the structure based on the mesh model. The idea, Hover says, is for the robot to cover every point in the mesh; in this case, each point is spaced 10 centimeters apart, narrow enough to detect a small mine.\n\nOne approach, he says, might be to have the robot sweep over the structure much like one would mow a lawn, one strip at a time — a common technique in robotic inspection. But such rectangular surveys can be tedious and time-consuming. Instead, the researchers came up with a more efficient approach, using optimization algorithms to program the robot to sweep across the structures while taking into account their complicated 3-D shapes.\n\nThe group’s technique significantly shortens the path a robot needs to follow to view an entire ship. “Over a minute or two of computation, we’re able to make tremendous improvements to the length of this path, and do so while keeping every single point in view,” Englot says.\n\nGaurav Sukhatme, a professor of computer science at the University of Southern California who was not involved in this work, sees the group’s work as an integrated approach to multiple problems, including “the extraordinary amount of data the vehicle has to intelligently process, and the safety considerations when operating near a hull that is being imaged or examined. I think a big application is going to be in servicing existing underwater rigs, and in decommissioning rigs no longer slated for use,” Sukhatme says.\n\nThe team has tested its algorithms in the field, creating underwater models of two vessels: the Curtiss, a 183-meter military support ship in San Diego, and the Seneca, an 82-meter cutter in Boston. The group is performing tests this month in Boston Harbor.\n\n“The goal is to be competitive with divers in speed and efficiency, covering every square inch of a ship,” Englot says. “We think we’re close.”\nThis research is supported by the Office of Naval Research.	f	f	f	0	0	0	Algorithms enable robot to navigate and view propellers and other complex structures.

But black magic or no, roboticists at the Harbin Institute of Technology in China have managed to make it work on a robotic insect that, in addition to <em>walking</em> on water, can also<em>jump</em>.\n\nModeled after a water strider, the legs of this robot are made of a a porous, water-repellent nickel foam. Real water striders, of course, do not have nickel foam legs, but the concept is the same: you spread the weight of the robot out enough that the surface tension of the water can support it. This is a tall order for a robot this large: weighing in at 11 grams, this porker is over a thousand times the mass of its biological inspiration.\n\nTo get the robot to jump, a separate set of legs was added, bringing the total to five. By using these actuating legs to push against the surface of the water, the robot was able to make leaps 14 centimeters high and 35 centimeters long, taking off at nearly 65 kph, which impressive for such a little guy.\n\nLike that <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/military-robots/video-friday-the-cias-declassified-robotic-spy-critters">CIA fish from last week</a>, a robot with these capabilities could be used for, uh, "water quality monitoring," 'cause that's totally what the CIA is into.

Instead of using arms or legs, it's got a sort of combination of both: two long tentacles made out of chains of servos that it uses to crawl around and rapidly somersault from place to place.\n\nThis robot was built (or should we say invented) by Eiichiro Morinaga, the guy who founded the ROBO-ONE bipedal humanoid competition.

Adding a simple manipulator to the ends of those tentacles, for example, would create a robot that could use all those degrees of freedom to grasp stuff as well as to move, although doing both at once would be a little tricky.

But if you're working alongside this burly bot (<em>hello ISS crew!</em>), fear not: Robonaut has fully compliant arms and even a built-in emergency shut-down mechanism. He's also one cool, fist-bumping robot.\n\n<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/robonaut">Robonaut 2</a>, designed jointly by NASA's Johnson Space Center and General Motors, is the second generation of the Robonaut series, and <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/robonaut-gets-unpacked-finally">one unit is already</a> <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/how-robonaut-2-will-help-astronauts-in-space">on the International Space Station</a> <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/this-will-be-robonaut-new-job-on-the-iss-for-now">helping the crew</a>. It's a good thing that NASA has clones of the robot, so us earthlings have a chance to see it too. Last week, several members of the Robonaut team, based in Houston, Texas, came to St. Paul, Minn., to attend the <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/icra+2012">2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation</a> and they brought along a Robonaut to demo at the <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/icra-2012-video-montage">show floor</a>.\n\nAt the NASA JSC booth,  Ron Diftler, the Robonaut 2 project manager,gave some great details about the capabilities and safety features of the robot's arms. He explained that the robot uses an impedance controller, which can adjust the stiffness of the arms. This means the arms have limited torque and won't cause damage to objects—or the crew. "We went through very rigorous safety evaluations before we can send this robot to the space station," Diftler told . "So that you would feel very comfortable shaking hands with it."\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone aligncenter" src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/img/robonaut%20hands%20icra%202012-1337699879623.JPG" alt="" width="360" height="538" /></p>\nDiftler also told  about some of Robonaut's jobs at the ISS. He said the robot is, among other things, assisting the crew with air flow measurements. Before they had the robot, the astronauts had to monitor air flow themselves. Now Robonaut just grabs an air flow meter and performs the measurements, not only collecting data more frequently than before but also freeing the crew from a boring task.\n\nThe idea is that Robonaut will increasingly <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/how-robonaut-2-will-help-astronauts-in-space">take on other jobs, helping the crew with experiments and maintenance</a>. For that, the Robonaut team designed the robot with varying levels of autonomy, Diftler said. In autonomous mode, the robot can perform tasks that require little or no supervision. For tasks that require a crew member to monitor or assist the robot, a "supervised autonomy" mode is used. Finally, there are more complex situations when remote operation is the best option, and in those cases an operator (aboard the ISS or on Earth) can use teleoperation gear to fully control the robot.\n\nAnd if you're still worried that Robonaut will pull a HAL and turn against the crew, know that Robonaut has a built-in emergency stop mechanism: just give one of its arms a good nudge and the robot will shut down. At least that's the hope.\n<p style="text-align: center;">SOURCE: <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/how-robonaut-arms-work">http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/how-robonaut-arms-work</a></p>	f	f	f	0	0	0	Robonaut's dexterous hands rely on tendon-driven fingers to grasp objects much like our own hands do.

This replicates behaviors in cockroaches and geckos, and may lead to a new generation of acrobatically-inclined insectobots.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Video link</strong>: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcbvukuvTps&amp;feature=player_embedded">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcbvukuvTps&amp;feature=player_embedded</a></p>\nCockroaches have a notorious (and much hated) ability to vanish from sight before your brain even decides you should take a swat at it. And if you've ever tried to chase down a gecko (and seriously, who hasn't), you know that they're not just fast, but they're also incredibly agile. These abilities stem in great part from the fact that cockroaches and geckos are small and light, and consequently don't have to overcome much inertia when changing direction. We've only recently been able to take advantage of technologies that allow for the creation of robots at similar scales, and such robots (like DASH) <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-software/dash-hexapedal-cockroach-inspired-robot">exhibit impressive speed and agility</a>.\n\nRecently, researchers at UC Berkeley's PolyPEDAL Lab, led by Professor Robert Full, demonstrated that cockroaches can perform "rapid inversions" on a ledge, a previously unknown behavior. Surprisingly, while on a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">vacation</span> research trip at the Wildlife Reserves near Singapore, the researchers discovered a similar behavior in lizards and documented geckos using this technique in the jungle to escape predators and nosy scientists. Next, Full's group teamed up with roboticists from Berkeley's <a href="http://robotics.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ronf/Biomimetics.html">Biomimetic Millisystems Lab</a> to see if DASH could be taught to do the same sort of thing.\n\nDASH, unlike cockroaches or geckos (or <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/diy/no-couch-is-safe-from-clash-clothclimbing-robot">CLASH</a>, for that matter), doesn't come with claws, so the researchers "simulated claw action" by sticking some Velcro onto DASH's front and hind legs, and then adding more Velcro to the top and underside of the ledge to form pivot and catch points.\n\n<img class="aligncenter" src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/img/Figure-1R-1339049326390.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250" />\n\nSince the whole Velcro thing is kind of cheating if you're trying to design a robot inspired by animals (as opposed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velcro#History">plants</a>), the Berkeley researchers have started to develop designs for both active and passive bio-inspired claws.

In other words, according to the UVA researchers, rays are "wonderful examples of optimal engineering by nature."</p>\n<p>UVA's bioengineers aren't the first roboticists to have noticed how awesome the ray is at being all ray-like. Festo, which knows a thing or two about robots inspired by nature, made both aerial and aquatic versions of rays that are <a href="http://www.hizook.com/blog/2008/10/19/festo-manta-rays-dirigible-and-submersible">quite acrobatic</a>. What UVA is doing differently, however, is focusing on all the subtle ways that aquatic rays can control themselves, with the idea of developing an underwater robot that can do the same thing: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66N7Xkxazc&amp;feature=player_embedded">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66N7Xkxazc&amp;feature=player_embedded</a></p>\n<p>Making turns like that is an ability completely unique to the ray design, and it's a great illustration of why bioroboticists are so interested in getting all the details right.

The topics to be discussed will be announced and updated before each class. Moreover, for most of the theoretical classes, which will be held on Fridays or Saturdays, there will be an accompanying hands-on session so that members may get the practical exposure that will aid their learning. This general process will continue throughout the academic year.\n\nIn the winter, we will be hosting another of the memorable freshers’ robotics events of the year; the annual Winter Workshop. Held in the winter vacations, in two phases to accommodate the astudents with EAA obligations, the Winter Workshop is where most of the first years make their first ever fully functioning autonomous or image processing robot from scratch, under the able guidance of their seniors. It is held for about a week, and is a period of intense learning and even more intense fun and enjoyment. A test will be conducted for participation in the Winter Workshop, towards the end of the semester.\n\nNext year will see many of the KRAIG members participating with full gusto for the events of ROBOTIX 2013. It is our hope that the effort put into teaching them will pay off with dividend in January.

There are approximately 975 bajillion different objects out there in the world that robots need to know how to interact with, and the only way we're going to learn about them all (short of Google throwing approximately 975 bajillion dollars at the problem) is through a cooperative, crowdsourced effort like this new project called Kinect@Home.\n\nWhat Kinect@Home wants to do is to harness the power of all of those Kinects that roboticists and gamers have lying around out there and put them to work recording 3D models of, uh, pretty much everything. Here's how it works:\n<ul>\n\t<li>You download some drivers and a plugin from the Kinect@Home website.</li>\n\t<li>Plug your Kinect into your computer.</li>\n\t<li>Run the plugin, and move your Kinect slowly around whatever it is that you want to create a model of.</li>\n\t<li>The data gets uploaded and rendered in the cloud, and you get back a nifty browsable, embeddable 3D model like this:</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n<iframe style="width: 300px; height: 300px;" src="http://www.kinectathome.com/models/c25adb3f-4a03-481b-8c61-4c0293072250/?embed=1" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" width="320" height="240"></iframe>\nIf you want to get crazy and download the model itself and mess with it, you can do that too. Cool!</p>\nThe whole point of this is not really to give you a nifty new 3D modeling tool. Rather, Kinect@Home is hoping that people will make scans of every single last one of those 975 bajillion different objects that exist, which Kinect@Home can then analyze, categorize, and use to create better computer vision algorithms. From a more practical standpoint, we're talking about teaching robots to be better at navigating environments and manipulating objects.\n\nFor example, let's say that we want to teach a robot to open a refrigerator. To do that, a robot first has to recognize a refrigerator, but there are all kinds of different refrigerators and we have no idea what particular sort our robot is going to be asked to deal with. With a Kinect@Home dataset, it might be possible to go check out models of thousands of refrigerators in people's homes, and use those models to teach our robot how to locate (and even open) a generalized fridge. And once the dataset exists, there are all kinds of other things that we could do with it too, from object recognition to semantic mapping to localization to scene comprehension.\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gvd95Z6AiuM?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" width="640" height="360"></iframe></p>\nKinect@Home is totally, completely free, and you can download it at the link below.\n\n[ <a href="http://www.kinectathome.com/">Kinect@Home</a> ]\n\nSource: <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/kinecthome-wants-to-start-3d-scanning-the-world">http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/kinecthome-wants-to-start-3d-scanning-the-world</a>\n\n&nbsp;	f	f	f	0	0	0	Back in January, Adept's Erin Rapacki told that it's time to start 3D scanning the world.

Can it become a high-tech nexus for robotics too?\n\n<img class="aligncenter" src="http://blogs-images.forbes.com/briancaulfield/files/2012/06/0605_silicon-valley-restoration-robotics_400x2801.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="280" />\n\n"Yes," says <a href="http://www.sri.com/about/people/mahoney.html">Rich Mahoney</a>, director of robotics at <a href="http://www.sri.com/">SRI International</a>, in Menlo Park, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley. And to make sure that people know it, he and his colleagues at SRI, along with local robotics companies such as <a href="http://www.adept.com/">Adept Technology</a> and <a href="http://www.willowgarage.com/">Willow Garage</a>, have formed a group called <a href="http://svrobotics.org/">Silicon Valley Robotics</a> ( SVR ). The goal of SVR is to "nurture the robotics industry in this area and help create an environment where other companies would want to come here and start up," he says.\n\nThere are other robotics centers in the United States, most notably the Boston area surrounding the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and also Pittsburgh, where Carnegie Mellon University resides. The greater Silicon Valley area has Stanford University and U.C. Berkeley, and quite a heritage of robotics accomplishments too, but compared to these other regions, the area has been "overlooked in some ways as being a center for robotics," says Mahoney [photo, right]. The reason for it may be that "there was so much other activity going on here and that robotics was lost relative to all the other things."\n\nMahoney had already been in robotics for over 20 years before he came to work in Silicon Valley in September 2008. Once he arrived, he was surprised to find there was a real cluster of robotics companies and research groups in this area, and yet unlike Boston and Pittsburgh, there was no organization representing that industry. So he started talking about the idea of forming a group where people in the robotics industry can get together to network and discuss important issues. With Philip von Guggenberg and Regis Vincent at SRI, Mahoney started having weekly meetings to talk about ways to make it happen and put together a mailing list. The group grew organically with volunteers organizing meetings, but it was not until this year's <a href="http://www.nationalroboticsweek.org/">National Robotics Week</a>, when Silicon Valley Robotics endorsed and managed the <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/sri-shows-new-taurus-prototype-at-stanford-robot-block-party">Robot Block Party</a> at Stanford, that they decided to get exposure.\n\nThe group consists of about 40 organizations and is still in an informal grass roots stage. They get together at members' facilities for networking events. Right now the plan is to form a "leadership council" by the end of this year which will define the structure of the organization so that it can move on to the next stage. SRI, Adept, Willow Garage and German electronics company Robert Bosch, which conducts robotics research at its <a href="http://www.bosch.us/content/language1/html/rtc.htm">facility in Palo Alto</a>, are interested in participating in this council, according to Mahoney. Currently there is no membership fee and "any organization in the greater Silicon Valley region interested in the robotics industry can be a part of it," he notes.\n\n<img class="aligncenter" src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/image/1885401" alt="" width="450" height="338" />\n\nAs robots jump out of the factory floors into homes and communities, the robotics industry promises to grow dramatically, and Silicon Valley will be competing with other areas for talent and investment. Recently, French robotics company <a href="http://www.aldebaran-robotics.com/en">Aldebaran Robotics</a> decided to set up its U.S. operation in Boston. Mahoney says that Aldebaran had been looking at San Francisco as a potential location. "I am absolutely convinced that if there was a Silicon valley Robotics fully organized that I could have referred them to, to promote and attract them, that they would be in San Francisco," Mahoney points out.\n\nOn the other hand, there is also the need to cooperate with the other robotics regions to get their message heard in Washington, in regards to regulations, immigration and liability issues, which need to be made clear for the market to grow. And from that standpoint, a group like SVR will play an important role as the region's "single voice" so that it can "cooperate to elevate the resources and attention of the whole country."\n\nSVR is also planning on organizing an "investor forum" to get the local venture capitalists interested in the robotics field. Much of the funding in robotics research in the U.S. has so far been from the military budget and for the robotics industry to bloom there is need for investment from the private sector - just as the Internet started with military funding and then blossomed into an industry. When Mahoney gave a talk on the state of robotics at a local industry event, he got "blank stares." "There's a whole industry here that's starting to emerge and if you are in the investment community, you have to pay attention," he emphasizes.\n\n"As an outsider coming in, I find Silicon Valley a remarkable place with an aura, a concentration of technical know-how combined with an innovative spirit. I have no doubt that once the dots get connected, that things will happen quickly."\n\nSource: <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/next-big-thing-in-silicon-valley-robotics">http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/next-big-thing-in-silicon-valley-robotics</a>	f	f	f	0	0	0	Silicon Valley is known for its software, semiconductor, and Internet companies.

Within minutes, they spot their target near the edge of town. With no way to navigate through the streets, they radio for help. Soon after, a metallic blue SUV begins moving cautiously but purposefully along the dirt roads leading to town, seeking out the target's GPS coordinates. Meanwhile, the planes continue to circle overhead, gathering updated information about the target and its surroundings. In less than half an hour after the planes take to the sky, the SUV has zeroed in on its quarry. Mission accomplished.\n\nLast fall, Research team fielded these vehicles at Fort  Benning, Ga., during the U.S. Army's Robotics Rodeo. The two quarter-scale Piper Cub aircraft and the Porsche Cayenne operated without any humans at the controls. Instead, each robot had an onboard computer running collaborative software that transformed the three machines into an autonomous, interoperable system.\n\nThe demonstration may sound simple—the target was just a tarp staked to the ground—but had this been the streets of Kabul or Baghdad, where any pile of debris can conceal a deadly improvised explosive device, such autonomous tracking robots in the future could help keep soldiers out of harm's way. Indeed, military leaders have increasingly embraced the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other robotic systems over the past decade, to handle the "three D's": the dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks of war. Back in 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) had fewer than 50 UAVs in its inventory; by early 2010, it had more than 7000. In 2009, the U.S. Air Force started training more pilots to operate unmanned systems than to fly fighters and bombers. And according to market research firm ABI Research, 65 countries now use military robots or are in the process of acquiring them.\n\n<img class="aligncenter" src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/image/1893701" alt="" width="148" height="161" />\n\nThe ranks of battlefield robots will only grow: The U.S. Congress has mandated that by the year 2015, one-third of ground combat vehicles will be unmanned, and the DOD is now developing a multitude of unmanned systems that it intends to rapidly field. Meanwhile, thousands of robotics researchers worldwide are making impressive gains in networking robots and boosting the sophistication and autonomy of these systems.\n\nDespite the advances in both their performance and safety, these robots are still far from perfect, and they routinely operate in situations for which they may not have been designed and in which their responses cannot always be anticipated. Some of the DOD's most advanced UAVs carry dozens of sensors, including high-resolution night-vision cameras, 3-D imagers, and acoustic arrays. Yet most cannot distinguish a sleeping dog from a bush, even at high noon. Humans are still needed to operate the vehicles, interpret the data, and coordinate tasks among multiple systems. If we are ever to see fully autonomous robots enter the battlefield—those capable of planning and carrying out missions and learning from their experiences—several key technological advances are needed, including improved sensing, more agile testing, and seamless interoperability. Even then, a basic question will remain: How can we equip these robots to make critical decisions on their own?\n\nSource: <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/military-robots/autonomous-robots-in-the-fog-of-war/0">http://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/military-robots/autonomous-robots-in-the-fog-of-war/0</a>\n\n&nbsp;	f	f	f	0	0	0	Networks of autonomous robots will someday transform warfare,but significant hurdles remain.

It's inflated and deflated with an on-board pump, and uses actuators and strings to move its joints without embedded motors. While regular <strong>PackBot 3</strong>-link arms are between 15 and 20 pounds, the AIRarm system only weighs about a tenth of that, a fact that would be much appreciated by the soldiers that have to carry these robots around. Despite its light weight, AIRarm is no slouch, and can lift up to five pounds, or possibly more depending on how much its inflated. By varying the level of inflation, it's also possible to vary the level of compliance of the arm: this makes the arm a little bit flexible when you need it to be, which in turn makes it safer and more durable. Since it's mostly made of fabric and string, it's wicked cheap, at least compared to a conventional arm.\n\nAs it turns out, you can do more with inflatable structures and actuators than just make arms.

But when you start making small robots, like <em>seriously </em>small robots (on the millimeter scale), you have to find new ways to get them to jump, and the Army Research Laboratory has teamed up with the University of Maryland to develop a couple clever ideas.\n\nPictured above is a four millimeter-long robot, complete with a power source, an integrated control system, and light sensors. To move, it relies on on the rapid conversion of stored chemical energy to gas in a chemical reaction, which is just a fancy way of saying either "rocket motor" or "controlled explosion." Underneath the robot is a small chip of nano porous silicon that gets infused with a sodium perchlorate oxidizer, and when a current heats up the chip, it ignites, propelling the robot upward. Initial tests have yielded a jump height of about eight centimeters, which doesn't sound like much, but the robot is so small that it's still outjumping its own size by a factor of 20.\n\nThe other jumping bot that these researchers have come up with is a bit more traditional, using micro fabricated elastomer springs to store up energy and release it all at once to make a jump. This method may be a bit less violent than the rocket-powered bot, but the spring robot depends on an external power source (a dude pushing the spring down with tweezers). With this human help (which will eventually replaced by micro motors to wind the spring up) it can jump really, <strong>really</strong> high, at about 80 times its own height. You can see both of these robots in action in the video below:\n\n<center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hrlTwbiZmTE?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" width="360" height="300"></iframe></center>The next step for these robots is to tweak them to be able to jump more than once and to figure out how to get them to land properly, do productive stuff once they return to Earth. For the chemical jumping robot, adding little nozzles to the chemical engine should solve the steering problem while also quadrupling its effective power by directing the thrust more efficiently. Stitching an array of about 100 of these engines together along the bottom of a microbot could allow for a whole series of jumps (and even jumps followed by mid-air rocket pulses to keep flying), ultimately resulting in a range of some 65 meters, which works out to be a staggering 16,000 times the length of the robot itself.\n\n"First Leaps Toward Jumping Microrobots" by Wayne A. Churaman, Aaron P. Gerratt, and Sarah Bergbreiter from the Army Research Laboratory and the University of Maryland Microrobotics Lab was presented this week at the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.\n\nSource : <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/diy/tiny-robot-makes-big-jumps-with-explosive-microrockets">http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/diy/tiny-robot-makes-big-jumps-with-explosive-microrockets</a>	f	f	f	0	0	0	We've seen all kinds of crazy jumping robots, from humanoids to grasshoppers to soft and flexible spheres.

66	Brilliant Little Jumping Robot Only Needs One Motor 	brilliant-little-jumping-robot-only-needs-one-motor	2	\N	\N	2012-10-23 22:06:40+05:30	2015-06-24 12:46:57.551835+05:30	<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone" src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/image/1869270" alt="" width="450" height="354" /></p>\nJumping offers a way for very small robots to get over very large obstacles using a minimal amount of energy. It's tricky, though, because while the first jump might be pretty easy, subsequent jumps depend on the ability of the robot to right itself, aim, and go again. That's essentially three separate subsystems, but since you're only ever using one at a time, the risk is that your robot ends up being three times as bulky as is strictly necessary. And in small robots, efficiency is everything.\n\nEPFL's locust-inspired jumping robot solves one of these problems with a weighted roll cage that helps the bot passively return to an upright position whenever it lands. A second motor then allows the robot to rotate within the cage to change its jumping direction. This works quite well, but it adds bulk plus another motor to the whole system.\n\nJianguo Zhao and a team from Michigan State University have created a jumping robot that somehow manages to do everything that it needs to do with just one single motor. It can change its orientation, right itself, and then jump (really freakin' high) with one motor and some clever mechanical engineering. Check it out:\n\n<center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XxHRqZGQM38" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></center>&nbsp;\n\nThe actual jumping mechanism was directly inspired by the legs of a frog, but it's really the rest of the robot that's so cool. Everything is driven by one tiny pager motor, and here's how it works:\n<ul>\n\t<li>To jump, the pager motor engages a gear which pulls the robot's body down towards its legs, slowly charging four torsional springs. The gearing and springs help keep the power requirements low without sacrificing jumping energy. When the springs are fully charged up, the gear trips a little lever, and the legs are released. <em>Boing!</em></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>After re-entry, the robot inevitably finds itself lying prone. By driving the pager motor backwards, the same gear that charges the springs instead spins against the ground without engaging anything, allowing the body of the robot to rotate to a new position.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>To get up, as the robot's body is pulled down towards its legs, little arms deploy outwards, driven by that same downward motion. These arms push the robot up into a standing position, and keep it there until liftoff.</li>\n</ul>\nIt's efficient, too: the robot is 8 centimeters tall and only weighs 20 grams, including the motor and a 50 mAh battery, but it can make approximately <strong>285</strong> jumps without needing to be recharged.\n\nThe designers think that it should be possible to make the robot jump even higher and farther, and of course at some point they're going to want to stick some sensors on there or something to move it from just being awesome to being awesome and useful at the same time.\n\nThis robot was presented at <a href="http://staging.spectrum.ieee.org/tag/icra+2011">ICRA</a> in a paper entitled "Development of a Controllable and Continuous Jumping Robot" by Jianguo Zhao, Ning Xi, Bingtuan Gao, Matt W.

For example, check out the picture of Stickybot III's toes in this article, and notice how little of the adhesive the robot is relying on to stick. This is one of the advantages of the TBCP-11: the continuous loops of adhesive material provide a lot of adhesion power.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>While this robot does have some autonomous capability, it's still tethered for power, since batteries are heavy. It's going to take a little extra work to increase the strength of the adhesive so that the TBCP-11 can bring its power source onboard, and the SFU researchers are also trying to figure out how to get the thing to turn without the treads coming loose and causing the TBCP-11 to plummet to its doom.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Source : <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/diy/climbing-robot-tank-can-corner-like-a-gecko">http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/diy/climbing-robot-tank-can-corner-like-a-gecko</a></div>	f	f	f	0	0	0	This is not the first sticky-treaded robotank, but it's the first one that can manage to go around corners and make that tricky transition from horizontal to vertical.

Paleontologists have decided that they're going to try to build themselves anatomically correct and fully functional robot dinosaurs to investigate how the animals moved, and definitely not to enact any sort of evil world domination scheme. They promise.\n\nDinosaurs were big. Some of them were really, <em>really</em> big. Like, 75 metric tons big. This is about 15 times heavier than a large elephant, and we have no idea how animals of that size were able to move around effectively. We have some guesses, but in order to find out for sure, we'd have to either clone them (which we should totally do at some point because nothing could ever go wrong), or build an anatomically correct robotic replica.\n<div><img class="aligncenter" src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/img/dino_reconstruct-1330322335045.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="307" />\nDrexel University paleontologists are already hard at work making 3D scans of sauropod leg bones with the goal of having a working limb (complete with simulated tendons and muscle) running around by the end of 2012. The 3D scans will be fed into a 3D printer, which ought to be able to correct for millions of years worth of deformation caused by fossilization and compression when it prints out replica bones. With a complete musculoskeletal system to experiment on, the researchers hope to be able to figure out how giant dinosaurs were able to stand up, whether they could trot or canter or actually run, and also how they, you know, reproduced with each other.Putting together a complete robotic dinosaur replica will take a couple years, and it's important to note that it'll just be a replica, and won't offer conclusive proof about how dinos did or didn't get around.

The locomotion, sensors and processing.</em>\n\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Locomotion:</span></strong>\n\n<strong></strong>The locomotion system we are using here is the differential drive. It is a basic design with two motors, two wheels and a castor wheel. The chassis is a ready-made steel chassis that can be bought of the internet.\n\n[caption id="attachment_450" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Fig: Chassis for the differential Drive"]<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/1.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-450" title="1" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/1-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]\n\n[caption id="attachment_450" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Fig: Rectifier Circuit with 7805 and 7812 ICs"]<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image12.jpg" target="_blank"><img class=" wp-image-450   " title="1" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image12.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sensor:</span></strong>\n\n<strong></strong>This is the most important part of the robot. We have used here a three sensor layout which enables the robot to sense any light source in front of it. Of course, there can be several more different layouts to optimize the performance of the robot. Below is the picture of the sensory circuit mounted on the robot.\n\n[caption id="attachment_455" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Fig: Sensor circuit and its placement on the chassis"]<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image09.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-455" title="3" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image09.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]\n\n[caption id="attachment_454" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Fig: Sensor circuit and its placement on the chassis"]<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/4.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-454" title="4" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/4-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]\n\nLet us mark these sensors as left(L), right(R) and centre(C) sensors. The ultimate goal of our code is to find which sensor receives maximum intensity and to face the robot in that direction. Below diagram shows the circuitry in the sensor circuits:\n\n[caption id="attachment_453" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Fig: Circuitry of the sensor circuit"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-453" title="2" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2-300x220.png" alt="" width="300" height="220" />[/caption]\n\nEach sensor has to be provided a 5V Vcc supply and a data(D) output has to be taken out from it.  Three sensor circuits as shown in fig 2 will complete our sensory part of the robot.\n\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Processing:</span></strong>\n\nWe are here using an Atmega 16A microcontroller running at 16Mhz. The development board and programmer that are used here are available at <a href="http://www.robokits.in">www.robokits.in</a>. Of course there are several other sites too from where development boards and programmers can be acquired.\n\n[caption id="attachment_450" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Fig: Development Board for the microprocessor"]<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-450" title="1" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image11.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]\n\nFor the basics regarding the Atmega 16A microcontroller, refer to its datasheet which is available online.\n\nSo let’s get down to the connections. Here we have 3 sets of inputs coming from the 3 sensors. As these are analog signals, in order to process them, we need to provide this input to the Analog-to-Digital converter or the ADC. The ADC on the Atmega is located on the Port A. So the inputs from the sensors go to the first three pins of Port A( PA0, PA1, PA2, PA3). Now as the LED array on the development board is attached to the Port B, we will be using this port as the output from the microcontroller. From the microcontroller, the outputs have to go to the motor driver circuit which is used to run the motors.\n\nAs the motor driver consists of two enable pins we have to provide a high to both these pins. So we use the pins PB0 and PB1 to do this. The other 4 inputs to the motor driver we provide using the pins PB3, PB4, PB5, and PB6. Below is a circuit diagram showing the connections for a motor driver circuit.\n\n[caption id="attachment_456" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Fig: Connections of a motor driver IC L293D"]<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/6.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-456" title="6" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/6-300x164.png" alt="" width="300" height="164" /></a>[/caption]\n\n[caption id="attachment_456" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Fig: Motor driver IC L293D Circuit"]<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image13.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-456" title="6" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image13.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="164" /></a>[/caption]\n\nThe voltage supply at Vs is used for running the 12V 100rpm motors while the 5V supply at Vss is used for powering the internal circuitry of the IC. Here one can easily see that according to these connections, the robot follows the following motions:\n<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">PB2</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">PB3</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">PB4</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">PB5</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">Motion</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">1</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">0</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">1</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">0</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">Forward</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">0</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">1</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">0</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">1</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">Backward</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">0</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">1</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">1</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">0</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">Left</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">1</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">0</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">0</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">1</p>\n</td>\n<td width="92">\n<p align="center">Right</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="text-align: left;">So now we get to the data processing.

They've added a rolling cage that allows the robot to roll along the ground as well as fly. Why would you want to do that? Because rolling requires a lot less power than flying. From the researchers:\n\nExperimental results show that the hybrid robot can travel a distance 4 times greater and operate almost 6 times longer than an aerial only system. It also solves one of the most challenging problems in terrestrial robot design — obstacle avoidance. When an obstacle is encountered, the system simply flies over it.\n\nThe research on this project is being done by Arash Kalantari and Matthew Spenko of IIT. The lab is also working other interesting projects including perched landing of micro air-vehicles, agile non-holonomic robots, and omnidirectional rough terrain robots.

Individual nanotubes can be 10,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair, yet pound-for-pound, can be 100 times stronger than steel.\n\n“The artificial muscles that we’ve developed can provide large, ultrafast contractions to lift weights that are 200 times heavier than possible for a natural muscle of the same size,” said Dr. Ray Baughman, team leader, Robert A. Welch Professor of Chemistry and director of the <a href="http://nanotech.utdallas.edu/">Alan G. MacDiarmid NanoTech Institute at UT Dallas</a>. “While we are excited about near-term applications possibilities, these artificial muscles are presently unsuitable for directly replacing muscles in the human body.”\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.utdallas.edu/news/imgs/photos/nanothread-700-2012-11jpg.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="164" /></p>\nDescribed in a study published in the Nov. 16 issue of the journal<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6109/928"><em>Science</em></a><em>,</em> the new artificial muscles are made by infiltrating a volume-changing “guest,” such as the paraffin wax used for candles, into twisted yarn made of carbon nanotubes. Heating the wax-filled yarn, either electrically or using a flash of light, causes the wax to expand, the yarn volume to increase, and the yarn length to contract.\n\nThe combination of yarn volume increase with yarn length decrease results from the helical structure produced by twisting the yarn.  A child’s finger cuff toy, which is designed to trap a person’s fingers in both ends of a helically woven cylinder, has an analogous action. To escape, one must push the fingers together, which contracts the tube’s length and expands its volume and diameter.\n\n“Because of their simplicity and high performance, these yarn muscles could be used for such diverse applications as robots, catheters for minimally invasive surgery, micromotors, mixers for microfluidic circuits, tunable optical systems, microvalves, positioners and even toys,” Baughman said.\n\nMuscle contraction – also called actuation – can be ultrafast, occurring in 25-thousandths of a second. Including times for both actuation and reversal of actuation, the researchers demonstrated a contractile power density of 4.2 kW/kg, which is four times the power-to-weight ratio of common internal combustion engines.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.utdallas.edu/news/imgs/photos/nanotech-lab-researchers-650-2012-11.jpg" alt="" width="455" height="303" /></p>\nTo achieve these results, the guest-filled carbon nanotube muscles were highly twisted to produce coiling, as with the coiling of a rubber band of a rubber-band-powered model airplane.\n\nWhen free to rotate, a wax-filled yarn untwists as it is heated electrically or by a pulse of light. This rotation reverses when heating is stopped and the yarn cools. Such torsional action of the yarn can rotate an attached paddle to an average speed of 11,500 revolutions per minute for more than 2 million reversible cycles. Pound-per-pound, the generated torque is slightly higher than that obtained for large electric motors, Baughman said.\n\nBecause the yarn muscles can be twisted together and are able to be woven, sewn, braided and knotted, they might eventually be deployed in a variety of self-powered intelligent materials and textiles. For example, changes in environmental temperature or the presence of chemical agents can change guest volume; such actuation could change textile porosity to provide thermal comfort or chemical protection. Such yarn muscles also might be used to regulate a flow valve in response to detected chemicals, or adjust window blind opening in response to ambient temperature.\n\nEven without the addition of a guest material, the co-authors found that introducing coiling to the nanotube yarn increases tenfold the yarn’s thermal expansion coefficient. This thermal expansion coefficient is negative, meaning that the unfilled yarn contracts as it is heated. Heating the yarn in inert atmosphere from room temperature to about 2,500 degrees Celsius provided more than 7 percent contraction when lifting heavy loads, indicating that these muscles can be deployed to temperatures 1,000 C above the melting point of steel, where no other high-work-capacity actuator can survive.\n\n“This greatly amplified thermal expansion for the coiled yarns indicates that they can be used as intelligent materials for temperature regulation between 50 C below zero and 2,500 C,” said Dr. Márcio Lima, a research associate in the NanoTech Institute at UT Dallas who was co-lead author of the<em>Science</em> paper with graduate student Na Li of Nankai University and the NanoTech Institute.\n\n“The remarkable performance of our yarn muscle and our present ability to fabricate kilometer-length yarns suggest the feasibility of early commercialization as small actuators comprising centimeter-scale yarn length,” Baughman said. “The more difficult challenge is in upscaling our single-yarn actuators to large actuators in which hundreds or thousands of individual yarn muscles operate in parallel.”\n\nOther UT Dallas Nanotech Institute researchers involved with the work were research associates Dr. Mônica Jung de Andrade, Dr. Jiyoung Oh and Dr. Dongseok Suh; Dr. Shaoli Fang, associate research professor; Dr. Mikhail Kozlov, research scientist; Carter Haines and Taylor Ware, graduate students in materials science and engineering; and Dr. Walter Voit, assistant professor of materials science and engineering.\n\nAdditional collaborators are from four continents:  Dr. Geoffrey M. Spinks and Dr. Javad Foroughi at the University of Wollongong in Australia; Dr. Min Kyoon Shin and Dr. Seon Jeong Kim at Hanyang University in South Korea; Dr. Yongsheng Chen at Nankai University in China; Dr. John D. W. Madden at the University of British Columbia in Canada; Leonardo D. Machado and Douglas S. Galvão at the State University of Campinas in Brazil; and Alexandre F. Fonseca at Sao Paulo State University in Brazil.\n\nThis research was principally funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, with additional funding from the Office of Naval Research, the Robert A.

And it’s downright amazing.\n\nShimi’s “head” is a set of high-quality speakers with an optimized shape for ideal sound reproduction. But a lot of speaker docks have that. What takes Shimi beyond just producing the ultimate in sound is that Shimi uses your iPhone as its brain, allowing it to not only know and understand your music, but to also know and understand what moves you.\n\nOnce the music starts, Shimi takes the stage. Five strategically placed motors allow it to dance to the beat of any song, with a variety of dance moves that fit the specific song and genre.\n\nAs your musical companion, Shimi always knows where you are in the room and points the speakers toward you. It also has the ability to react to humans, using advanced facial and speech recognition algorithms so Shimi will also respond to your voice, your taps, your gestures, learn your musical preferences and even recommend new music for you.\n\n“In a way, Shimi started out as an animated character.Team worked to nail down his personality and then we transferred that into the robot,” said Guy Hoffman, Chief Technology Officer. “The result is that Shimi doesn’t just play your music, he actually listens to it and enjoys it as much as you do.” (The day this thing greets me at the door and says, “Hey, have you heard the new Mumford &amp; Sons single? It’s. Just. Ridiculous.” is the day I start checking it for a Cyberdyne Systems logo…)\n\nShimi is targeting store shelves for February 2013, but you can preorder your Shimi today by backing their Kickstarter campaign. For just $149 you’ll get to bring home one of the first Shimi’s off the line, and save $50 off the projected retail price.

In a differential drive, two basic motors can be used to run the robot in all the required manners. Given below, is a simple demonstration of a differential drive.\n\n<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/1-300x225.png" width="300" height="225" />\n\nThis is a basic H-Bridge differential drive.

The LDR sensors have been used in a layout which enables the robot to sense any light except the one directly behind it. We have placed them on the robot in Left, Central and Right orientation (shown in the figure below).\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2-300x220.png" width="300" height="220" /></p>\nWe have marked the LDR sensors as left <b>(I-L)</b>, right <b>(I-R)</b> and centre <b>(I-C)</b> sensors. The objective is to find which sensor receives maximum intensity and to face the robot in that direction. And this is achieved as the LDR which receives the maximum amount of light will have the minimum resistance across its terminals and hence will be the one which gives the direction as to where the victim is. The diagram below shows the circuitry in the sensor circuit:\n\n<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image09.jpg" width="300" height="225" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEach sensor has to be provided with a 5V supply <b>(VCC)</b>and the output pin<b>(D)</b> data goes to the microcontroller. The 10K potentiometer is used between the LDR and the Ground.\n\n<b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vibration detection</span></i></b><b>:</b>\n\nHere, we have used a high sensitivity accelerometer - Triple axis accelerometer <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9652">MMA7361</a>. To understand the basics of accelerometer, see our <a href="http://www.robotix.in/tutorials/category/auto/accelero">tutorial on Accelerometer</a>.\n\nHere, a vibration is basically, rapid change in acceleration of a robot in the <b>direction perpendicular</b> (along z axis say) <b>to the motion of robot</b>. The best part about using an accelerometer is that when we are tapping the <b>Z pin</b> of the accelerometer, <b>the output is not affected by robots motion in x-y direction</b>.\n\nAccelerometer will give its best result when placed in contact with ground. But otherwise, the ADC readings are good even when it is placed on the robot.\n\nThe circuit diagram for this accelerometer is:\n<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Accelero-circuit.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1216 aligncenter" alt="Accelero circuit" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Accelero-circuit.png" width="222" height="185" /></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Accelero.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1217 alignnone aligncenter" alt="Accelero" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Accelero.png" width="180" height="161" /></a></p>\nThe SLP pin is connected to digital high<b>(VCC)</b> so that accelerometer is activated. The GSEL pin is grounded so that we get the higher sensitivity (MMA7361 is capable of providing 2 sensitivity modes). You can know more about this Integrated Circuit from its datasheet.\n\nThe <b>Zout pin</b> data goes as input to the microcontroller.\n\n<b>Processing</b>\n\nNow we have 2 types of sensor inputs (LDR sensors &amp; Accelerometer). We need to interface both of them for guiding our robot. So, the microcontroller needs to interpret both LDR sensor input and accelerometer input. The flowchart for the robot can be presented as shown below\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Flow-chart.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1218 aligncenter" alt="Flow chart" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Flow-chart.png" width="687" height="196" /></a>\n\nHere, we have used Atmega 16A as our microcontroller IC. We are using rhino development board for our purpose. The LCD makes thresholding easy for the accelerometer. Now, in this DIY, we’ll be using ADC for converting sensor data for the microcontroller.\n\nWe’ve used 3 LDR sensors which are attached on the robot. Hence we have 4 inputs to the microcontroller. 3 from LDR sensors and 1 from accelerometer. Since we are using ADC, we’ll have to connect it to the <b>PORTA</b> of Atmega 16A. Read our detailed <a href="http://www.robotix.in/tutorials/category/avr/adc">tutorial on ADC</a> (Analogue to Digital).\n\nRhino board has inbuilt facility of motordriver. So, here we didn’t have to make an external motordriver circuit.However, if you are not using rhino board, you’ll have to make a motordriver circuit whose circuit diagram would look as shown below\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/6.png"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/6.png" width="366" height="201" /></a></p>\n<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image13.jpg" width="300" height="225" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can take output from any port of microcontroller and connect it to the input pins of the motordriver (Input1, Input2, Input3, Input4, Enable1 and Enable2).Check out tutorial on <a href="http://www.robotix.in/tutorials/category/auto/motor_driver">Motor Driver</a> for further assistance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Algorithm</b>\n\nAs our problem statement is, the robot should follow the light and avoid the vibration areas on the way. So, our algorithm is as follows:\n\nFollow light --&gt; If   vibration centre --&gt;Avoid\n\nElse --&gt; continue\n\n<b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Light Following Algorithm</span></i></b>\n\nLet intensity of light on the respective Left, Right and Central LDR sensors be represented by I-L, I-R &amp; I-C.\n\nThen our algorithm for light following will be:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf(I-L is greatest)\n\n{           Turn Left     }\n\nElse If(I-R is greatest)\n\n{           Turn Right   }\n\nElse If (I-C is greatest)\n\n{           Go straight    }\n\nElse\n\n{             Take a Zero Radius turn   }\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vibration Detection Algorithm</span></i></b>\n\nAccelerometer will give you varying ADC readings.  The readings vary as shown in figure. This is a Matlab plot.\n\n<img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://robotix.in/uploads/tremors.png" width="720" height="540" />\n\nThe simplest way to detect vibration is take in account last few (let’s take 20) readings, find the difference between the maxima and minima amongst the last 20 readings. This difference is greater in the vibration zone and less in the non-vibrating zone. So, this difference can be thresholded to detected vibration. You can further modify your code so as to further filter your readings to get the difference. Here in this DIY, the 1st difference of 1st set of readings is used.  You can display this difference on LCD screen for thresholding purpose.\n\nLet the difference of the last 20 readings of accelerometer be stored in ‘<b><i>dif</i></b>’ and let ‘<b><i>threshdif</i></b>’ be the threshold difference.\n\nSo to detect vibration zone:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf (dif&gt;threshdif)\n\nVibration zone detected\n\nElse\n\nNormal zone\n\nOnce the vibration zone is detected, the robot can perform various manoeuvres to avoid it. It can take a sharp turn or move back. Here, in this DIY, once the vibration zone is detected, the robot will take a turn based on the intensity of light at the LDR sensors and then the robot will move forward. The turning of the robot should continue until the robot has exited the vibration zone\n\n<b>Code</b><b></b>\n\nThe code has been written as per the rhino development board used. It has the motordriver’s output connected at <b>PORT C</b> with its enable pins connected to <b>PORTD</b>. Input has been taken at<b>PORTA</b> -&gt;<b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PA0 </span></i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">-<i>PA2</i></span></b> (LDR sensor input) and <b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PA3</span></i></b>(Accelerometer input).\n\nIn the code, it has been assumed that ADC value is greater at greater light intensity. Note this depends on the connections done in the LDR sensor circuit.\n<pre>#define F_CPU 16000000UL\n#include avr/io.h;\n#include util/delay.h;\n\n//motor macros for the motor pins\n#define zeroleft 0b00010100\n#define zeroright 0b00101000\n#define right 0b00111000\n#define left 0b00011100\n#define forward 0b00011000\n#define back 0b00100100\n\nint main(void)\n{\n//setting motordriver ports as output ports\nDDRC=255;\nDDRD=255;\n\nPORTD=0b00110000; //setting enable pins high\n\n//setting PORTA as Input port\nDDRA=0b00000000;\n\n//ADC settings\nADCSRA=0b10000111;\n\n//declaration and initialization\nint i,LDRoutput[3],accelero[20], dif, threshdif=400,max,min;\n\nwhile(1)\n{\n\n//ADC settings\nADMUX=0b01000000|(1<<ADLAR);\n//ADC values of left, central and right LDR sensor stored in LDRoutput[0], LDRoutput[1], LDRoutput[2] respectively.\n\nfor(i = 0; i < 3; i++,ADMUX++)\n{\nADCSRA|=(1<<ADSC);\nwhile((ADCSRA&(1<<ADSC))!=0);\nLDRoutput[i] = ADCH;\n}\n\n//Light following algorithm\nif((LDRoutput[0]>LDRoutput[1])&&(LDRoutput[0]>LDRoutput[2]))\nPORTC=left;\nelse if((LDRoutput[2]>LDRoutput[0])&&(LDRoutput[2]>LDRoutput[1]))\nPORTC=right;\nelse if((LDRoutput[1]>LDRoutput[0])&&(LDRoutput[1]>LDRoutput[2]))\nPORTC=forward;\nelse\nPORTC=zeroright;\n\n//Vibration detection\n\n//ADC settings\nADMUX=0b01000011|(1<<ADLAR); //accelerometer input at pin3 of portA\nADCSRA=0b10000111;\n\nmin=1024 ;\nmax=0;\n\n//taking 20 Accelerometer readings and finding the difference of maxima and \n//minima followed by its storage in variable 'dif'.\nfor(i = 0; i < 20; i++)\n{\nADCSRA|=(1<<ADSC);\nwhile((ADCSRA&(1<<ADSC))!=0);\naccelero[i]=ADCH;\nif(accelero[i]>=max)\n{\nmax=accelero[i];\n}\nelse\n{\nif(accelero[i]<=min)\nmin=accelero[i];\n}\n}\ndif=max-min;\n\n//comparing this with the threshold value, of vibration zone, go back and take a turn\nif(dif>threshdif) //true when in Vibration zone\n{\nPORTC=back;\n_delay_ms(500);\nif(LDRoutput[0]>LDRoutput[2]) //True when Left LDR sensor receives more light intensity\n{\nPORTC=zeroleft;\n_delay_ms(500);\n}\nelse //This will happen when Right LDR sensor receives more light intensity\n{\nPORTC=zeroright;\n_delay_ms(500);\n}\nPORTC=forward;\n_delay_ms(500);\n}\n}\n}</pre>\nNow, assemble, code and your Tremors Robot is ready to run!	t	t	t	0	0	0	Problem Statement of Tremors: Build an Autonomous robot that can seek out victims present in the arena while detecting and avoiding earthquake affected vibration zones present in the arena.

Now, the robot will pick the cube from (1,2) and place it at the position (0,3).</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Note: Here when the node is marked, the robot does not actually travel to the marked position. You can find the nearest cube in the code itself as you already know the positions of cubes and voids.</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr">This is not the best method but this will give you results easily without much problem.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Best path to move block to void:</p>\n<p dir="ltr">The Optimal solution to the shortest path algorithm is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm">Dijkstra's algorithm</a>. This can give you the shortest path even when the distance between nodes are varying (i.e. the grid is not uniform). In our case, as the grid is uniform. When Dijkstra’s algorithm is applied on a graph with uniform lengths, it behaves like BFS(Breadth First Search). So, instead of applying Dijkstra’s algorithm BFS will also perform the same task with an added advantage being faster and easier to code than the Dijkstra’s algorithm. So, all you need to do is select a cube and apply BFS. While searching when you find the void you stop the search and you got your nearest voids coordinates. The only thing left to be done is to move a cube from one location to another!!</p>\n&nbsp;	t	t	t	0	0	0	Problem Statement of Transporter: Build an autonomous robot which can traverse a grid and place blocks in voids on the grid such that it optimises its path while completing this task.

The wing flapping also enhanced the aerial performance of the robot, consistent with the hypothesis that flight originated in gliding tree-dwellers.\n\nThe research team, led by Ron Fearing, professor of electrical engineering and head of the<a href="http://robotics.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ronf/Biomimetics.html">Biomimetic Millisystems Lab</a> at UC Berkeley, <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/6/4/046008">reports its conclusions online</a> Tuesday, Oct. 18, in the peer-reviewed journal <em>Bioinspiration and Biomimetics</em>.\n\nUsing robot models could play a useful role in studying the origins of flight, particularly since fossil evidence is so limited, the researchers noted.\n\nFirst unveiled by Fearing and graduate student Paul Birkmeyer in 2009, DASH is a lightweight, speedy robot made of inexpensive, off-the-shelf materials, including compliant fiber board with legs driven by a battery-powered motor. Its small size makes it a candidate for deployment in areas too cramped or dangerous for humans to enter, such as collapsed buildings.\n\n<strong>A robot gets its wings</strong>\n\nBut compared with its biological inspiration, the cockroach, DASH had certain limitations as to where it could scamper. Remaining stable while going over obstacles is fairly tricky for small robots, so the researchers affixed DASH with lateral and tail wings borrowed from a store-bought toy to see if that would help.\n\n“Our overall goal is to give our robots the same all-terrain capabilities that other animals have,” said Fearing. “In the real world, there will be situations where flying is a better option than crawling, and other places where flying won’t work, such as in confined or crowded spaces. We needed a hybrid running-and-flying robot.”\n\nThe researchers ran tests on four different configurations of the robotic roach, now called DASH+Wings. The test robots included one with a tail only and another that just had the wing’s frames, to determine how the wings impacted locomotion.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://robotics.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ronf/Ambulation/DASH+Wings/DASHWimages/DASH+Wings-1.jpg" alt="" width="794" height="706" /></p>\nWith its motorized flapping wings, DASH+Wings’ running speed nearly doubled, going from from 0.68 meters per second with legs alone to 1.29 meters per second. The robot could also take on steeper hills, going from an incline angle of 5.6 degrees to 16.9 degrees.\n\n“With wings, we saw improvements in performance almost immediately,” said study lead author Kevin Peterson, a Ph.D. student in Fearing’s lab. “Not only did the wings make the robot faster and better at steeper inclines, it could now keep itself upright when descending. The wingless version of DASH could survive falls from eight stories tall, but it would sometimes land upside down, and where it landed was partly guided by luck.”\n\nThe flapping wings improved the lift-drag ratio, helping DASH+Wings land on its feet instead of just plummeting uncontrolled. Once it hit the ground, the robot was able to continue on its way. Wind tunnel experiments showed that it is aerodynamically capable of gliding at an angle up to 24.7 degrees.\n\n<strong>Tree-dwellers vs. ground-runners</strong>\n\nThe engineering team’s work caught the attention of animal flight expert Robert Dudley, a UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology, who noted that the most dominant theories on flight evolution have been primarily derived from scant fossil records and theoretical modeling.\n\nHe referenced previous computer models suggesting that ground-dwellers, given the right conditions, would need only to triple their running speed in order to build up enough thrust for takeoff. The fact that DASH+Wings could maximally muster a doubling of its running speed suggests that wings do not provide enough of a boost to launch an animal from the ground. This finding is consistent with the theory that flight arose from animals that glided downwards from some height.\n\n“The fossil evidence we do have suggests that the precursors to early birds had long feathers on all four limbs, and a long tail similarly endowed with a lot of feathers, which would mechanically be more beneficial for tree-dwelling gliders than for runners on the ground,” said Dudley.\n\nDudley said that the winged version of DASH is not a perfect model for proto-birds – it has six legs instead of two, and its wings use a sheet of plastic rather than feathers – and thus cannot provide a slam-dunk answer to the question of how flight evolved.\n\n“What the experiments did do was to demonstrate the feasibility of using robot models to test hypotheses of flight origins,” he said. “It’s the proof of concept that we can actually learn something useful about biological performance through systematic testing of a physical model.”\n\nAmong other robotic insects being tested in the Biomimetic Millisystems Lab is a winged, bipedal robot called BOLT (Bipedal Ornithopter for Locomotion Transitioning) that more closely resembles the size and aerodynamics of precursors to flying birds and insects.\n\n“It’s still notable that adding wings to DASH resulted in marked improvements in its ability to get around,” said Fearing. “It shows that flapping wings may provide some advantages evolutionarily, even if it doesn’t enable flight.”\n\nThe National Science Foundation’s Center of Integrated Nanomechanical Systems, an NSF Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory helped support this research.	f	f	f	0	0	0	When engineers at the University of California, Berkeley, outfitted a six-legged robotic bug with wings in an effort to improve its mobility, they unexpectedly shed some light on the evolution of flight.

Its reach extended to all corners of India, bringing in teams from as far as Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Robotix currently sees the biggest participation amongst all such events in the country, and registered almost 600 teams this year, with a total of almost 2000 participants.\n\nIt comprised 7 events; 2 Manual Robotics Events, 2 Autonomous Robotics Events, an Image Processing Event, one workshop and an Online Coding Event.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/abyss.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-842" alt="abyss" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/abyss.png" width="431" height="221" /></a></p>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe two Manual events were Abyss and Overhaul. Witnessing a combined participation of almost 300 teams, they were a huge hit among both the audience and the participants. Overhaul was an event where the robot was required to traverse an uneven terrain, while bridging gaps and saving victims. It simulated a mountain rescue situation. It was a real crowd puller and saw a participation of almost 200 teams.  Abyss was an event where the robot was required to travel down a rope and save victims. This simulated a rescue from a well or canyon. It was the first time in the country, that a rope traversal event had been tried in any robotics fest. A participation of almost a hundred teams was observed, even though it was an unorthodox and relatively challenging event.\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/lumos1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-844" alt="lumos" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/lumos1.png" width="432" height="226" /></a>\n\nThe two autonomous events were Lumos and A.C.R.O.S.S. The event Lumos, involved a light sensing robot that would switch off light sources while avoiding objects, much like a firefly. This event saw nearly a whopping 100 teams, a number quite rare for an autonomous event in any robotics fest. The event A.C.R.O.S.S. or Automated Constructions Robot Operation Systems was a test of communication and planning, where one robot acted as a bridge for another to enable it to complete its path. This simulated automated construction. This saw participation by almost 40 teams, and considering the sheer complexity of the event, it was a decent number.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://robotix.in/css/images/eventpage/seeker.png" /></p>\nThe Image Processing event was called The Seeker, and it saw a participation of about 40 teams as well. The goal of this event was to build a robot which could process its surroundings and understand signals, enabling it to traverse the arena. This was much like a scaled down version of the self driving vehicle which understands symbols and drives itself accordingly.\n<p style="text-align: center;"> <img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://robotix.in/css/images/eventpage/marauder.png" width="220" height="220" /></p>\nThe online coding event was Marauder’s Map, and it was a revamped version of the travelling salesman problem with many more twists to it, in which the profit had to be optimized, given a map, overhead costs, and loot gained from each city, along with differing teams. This event garnered submissions from 20 quality teams, from all over the country.\n\nThe workshop, along with the subsequent line-follower event, was called Robo-Zest’13. It was aimed at the newcomers, and proved to be successful in piquing their interest in robotics, as almost 60 teams walked away with their very own line follower at the end of the workshop.\n\nAll in all, upon looking back at Robotix ’13, one might say that Technology Robotix Society has once again achieved its goal of spreading the culture of robotics in the country. The logically impeccable code segments, the unorthodox, yet mind-blowing mechanisms, and the almost insane genius displayed by the participants at Robotix ’13 is a testament to that.\n\nRobotix ’13. Enough said.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/577798_346357575476052_1397314253_n.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-874" alt="577798_346357575476052_1397314253_n" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/577798_346357575476052_1397314253_n.jpg" width="320" height="212" /></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">FOLLOW US!</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">Facebook: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/robotixiitkgp">http://www.facebook.com/robotixiitkgp</a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">Youtube: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/RobotixIITkgp">http://www.youtube.com/user/RobotixIITkgp</a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"></p>	t	t	t	0	0	0	ROBOTIX 2013, conducted during Kshitij, IIT Kharagpur’s annual technical fest, was an ensemble of events designed to test the mettle of the best robotics enthusiasts and coders from across the country.

114	Curiosity on Mars!	curiosity-on-mars	2	\N	\N	2013-04-29 16:43:39+05:30	2015-06-24 12:47:06.257706+05:30	&nbsp;\n\n<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://images.freshnessmag.com/wp-content/uploads//2012/08/nasa-NASA-curiosity-mars-rover-00.jpg" width="570" height="450" />\n\nNASA's Mars rover Curiosity just might be the latest in a long line of Mars-exploring robots to discover the building blocks for primitive life on the Red Planet.\n\nThe Curiosity rover may have gathered evidence for the presence of perchlorates in Rocknest — a sand patch inside the rover's Gale Crater landing site on the Red Planet, scientists say. If so, it shores up the case that the material may well be globally distributed on Mars.\n\nNot only can perchlorates, which are a class of salts, serve as an energy source for potential Martian microorganisms, they are also a sensitive marker of past climate and can lead to the formation of liquid brines under current conditions on the planet.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://regmedia.co.uk/2012/08/07/curiosity_nasa.jpg  " width="550" height="419" /></p>\n<strong>Curiosity's possible detection</strong>\n\nThe possible detection of perchlorates at Curiosity’s Gale crater site was spotlighted by Doug Archer, a scientist with the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Directorate of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. He is focused on the habitability of various Martian environments over time. [The Search for Life on Mars (A Photo Timeline)]\n\nArcher pointed to the rover’s Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite that recently ran four samples from Rocknest. That area was selected as the source of the first samples analyzed because it is representative of both windblown material in the Gale Crater and the planet's globally distributed dust, he said.\n\n"When we heated this up, we saw a large oxygen release at the same time we saw the release of these chlorinated hydrocarbons," Archer said, thus making a strong case for the presence of perchlorate salts in Rocknest's soil.\n\n<strong>Phoenix finding</strong>\n\nPerchlorates were first identified on Mars in the polar region by the Wet Chemistry Laboratory on NASA’s Phoenix lander in 2008.\n\nThis detection of perchlorates was corroborated by an oxygen release observed by the polar lander’s Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer instrument during analysis of a soil sample similar to the oxygen released from Rocknest samples, Archer said.\n\nArcher reported that the prospect of perchlorates in Rocknest material adds weight to the argument that both Viking landers in 1976 measured signatures of perchlorates, in the form of chlorinated hydrocarbons.\n\nSimilarly, Archer noted that other Mars robots — Sojourner, Spirit and Opportunity — also detected elemental chlorine. Moreover, orbital measurements by the Gamma Ray Spectrometer on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft show that chlorine is globally distributed at similar levels.\n<div>The Curiosity rover may have gathered evidence for the presence of perchlorates in Rocknest — a sand patch inside the rover's Gale Crater landing site on the Red Planet, scientists say. If so, it shores up the case that the material may well be globally distributed on Mars.NASA's Mars rover Curiosity just might be the latest in a long line of Mars-exploring robots to discover the building blocks for primitive life on the Red Planet.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/CuriosityDirtDiscovery_m_11.jpg" width="530" height="300" /></div>\n<strong>Implications for habitability</strong>\n\n"In all of these missions, we haven't always used the same technique … but we have always had the ability to measure chlorine in one way or another," Archer said. "If you look at these measurements at all of the landing sites … chlorine is relatively consistent in Martian soils," he said. [7 Biggest Mars Discoveries by the Curiosity Rover (So Far)]\n\n"I'm not saying that all of this chlorine everywhere on Mars is in the form of perchlorates … there are likely other chlorate salts as well," Archer said. "I believe that at least some of the chlorine at all of these locations is present as perchlorate."\n\nArcher said that the implications of globally distributed perchlorates are very important for climate, habitability and present-day aqueous processes.\n\nSpecifically, perchlorate has important implications for Mars habitability.\n<div>\n<div id="nointelliTXT">\n<div><strong>Growing in importance</strong></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"The perchlorate story keeps growing in importance since its discovery by the Phoenix mission in May 2008 and is changing the way that we conceive Mars," said Peter Smith, the Phoenix principal investigator of the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\nThe Phoenix lander spent a multi-month tenure digging up samples of Martian dirt and subsurface water ice, analyzing them for signs of the planet's past potential habitability.\n\nSmith said that perchlorate is apparently omnipresent at about 0.5 percent and is poisonous, making human missions to Mars even more hazardous.\n\n"Seasonal flow features may be caused by high concentration of the brines of perchlorate, which has a strong attraction to water and can drastically lower its freezing point," Smith told SPACE.com.\n\n"The soil perchlorate may have caused a false negative for the Viking experiment combusting organics with its release of oxygen above 200 degrees [Celsius]. And finally, perchlorate is an energy source for microbes on the Earth and perhaps serves that purpose on Mars as well," Smith said.\n\nNASA's $2.5 billion Mars rover Curiosity landed on Mars in August 2012 to begin a two-year primary mission aimed at determining whether the Red Planet could have ever supported microbial life. On March 12, NASA announced that Curiosity did indeed find proof that Mars was once habitable for primitive life in the ancient past. The announcement came from a detailed analysis by Curiosity of a rock sample drilled out of a Martian rock at a different science target - a rock called John Klein.\n\nCuriosity is yet to do much more wonders on Mars.	t	t	t	0	0	0	&nbsp; NASA's Mars rover Curiosity just might be the latest in a long line of Mars-exploring robots to discover the building blocks for primitive life on the Red Planet.

"It normally costs about $16,000, give or take, to put tactile sensing on a research robot hand. That's really limited where people can use it. The traditional technology also uses very specialized construction techniques, which can slow down your work. Now, Takktile changes that because it's based on much simpler and cheaper fabrication methods."\n\nTakkTile takes an existing device -- a tiny barometer, which senses air pressure -- and adds a layer of vacuum-sealed rubber to it, protecting it from as much as 25 pounds of direct pressure. Jentoft and co-creator Yaroslav Tenzer, a postdoctoral fellow, say that the chips can even survive a strike from a hammer or a baseball bat. At the same time, Takktile is sensitive enough to detect a very slight touch.\n\nThe result, when added to a mechanical hand, is a robot that knows what it's touching. It can pick up a balloon without popping it. It can pick up a key and use it to unlock a door.\n\nBeyond robotics, Jentoft and Tenzer suggest that the TakkTile sensor could be used in a range of electronic devices. A toy manufacturer could make a stuffed puppy that responds to petting; a medical device designer could create a laparoscopic gripper that's gentle enough to tease apart tissue during surgery.\n\n"Not everyone has the bandwidth to do the research themselves, but there are plenty of people who could find new applications and ways of using this," says Tenzer.\n\nThe sensors can be built using relatively simple equipment; the patented process relies on standard methods used in printed circuit board fabrication, along with access to a vacuum chamber. The tiny barometers are available cheaply because they have been widely used in cell phones and GPS units that can sense altitude.\n\nAlong with their adviser, Robert D. Howe, Abbott and James Lawrence Professor of Engineering at SEAS, Jentoft and Tenzer are pursuing commercial opportunities with help from Harvard's Office of Technology Development. Harvard plans to license the technology to companies interested in offering prefabricated sensors or in integrating TakkTile sensing into products such as robots, consumer devices, and industrial products.	t	t	t	0	0	0	&nbsp; Researchers at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have developed a very inexpensive tactile sensor for robotic hands that is sensitive enough to turn a brute machine into a dextrous manipulator.

"One of the reasons we wanted to make this a commercially available product is to get it into the hands of as many schools and students as possible."\n\nThat's going to take some time, and the project is still in development, as Gifford and his team learn what works, and what a high-tech product like a robot needs to have in order to function in the world of elementary school kids and daily use.\n\nAt his lab at the Connecticut Science Center, where he's currently scientist-in-residence, Gifford works with programmers who are developing the sequences the two-foot-tall robots, which are made by a French company called Aldebaran Robotics, use in their interactions with students.\n\n<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/images/kgo/cms_exf_2007/news/health/7003562_600x338.jpg" width="600" height="338" />\n\nWhile the robot engages the students one-on-one, someone else – right now a researcher, but hopefully soon a teacher or teacher's aide – guides the interaction from a laptop computer. The six sequences are flexible enough to be effective when working with children with different levels of ability: one child delightedly bangs on a drum along with the robot, while another runs through more complex verbal exercises designed to improve his ability to communicate with peers.\n\n"This system is really neat because the robot becomes the focus for the child. The robot acts as sort of the mediator or the deliverer of the information," Gifford says.\n\nFar from being a potential replacement for teachers, the robots will ideally become a powerful tool for communicating with students who have trouble understanding verbal cues or body language from adults.\n\nThe work is currently being done with students in kindergarten through fifth grade at Whiting Lane, with plans to expand to two other elementary schools soon. An exhibit on the project is also on display at the Connecticut Science Center, where one of the robots explains its functions with the aid of a video and a push-button console.\n\nAmong the challenges Gifford is working to address are the wear-and-tear the robots absorb over the course of sessions with the students, and what Gifford calls "the novelty factor."\n\n"We were worried the kids would get bored with the robots after a few weeks, but so far we've been able to consistently stimulate interest," thanks in part to the use of simpler toy robots in conjunction with the state-of-the-art Aldebaran models, Gifford says.\n\nAnd while more work remains to be done before their research can reach conclusions, Gifford is encouraged by what he's learned so far.\n\n"This is ultimately a very satisfying project to be involved in," he says. "It's something that's not just interesting from a research perspective, but something that can also make a difference in people's lives."\n\nProvided by University of Connecticut	t	t	t	0	0	0	A common enough scene, except the "you" in this case is a humanoid robot programmed by researchers affiliated with the University of Connecticut and Movia Robotics to help children with learning delays like those on the autism spectrum improve their social and communication skills.

The Morph demonstrates how future mobile devices might be stretchable and flexible, allowing the user to transform their mobile devices into radically different shapes. It demonstrates the ultimate functionality that nanotechnology might be capable of delivering: flexible materials, transparent electronics and self-cleaning surfaces.</div>\n</br>\n<b>What is its USP?</b></br>\n<div>This device concept showcases some revolutionary leaps in technology that will open up an entirely new spectrum of possibilities. We believe nanotechnology could provide enhanced usability, and enable far more intelligent devices. Consumers will want this because it adapts to the context of the user, is easy to use and transformable (such as wrapping it around the wrist). It will give us a new kind of connectivity to our surroundings, allowing us to connect in ways never thought of before through our mobile devices and so will give us new types of services like never before</div>\n<div>Some of its highlights will be:</div>\n<div><b>• Flexible &amp; Changing Design:</b> Nanotechnology enables materials and components that are flexible, stretchable, transparent and remarkably strong. Fibril proteins are woven into a three dimensional mesh that reinforces thin elastic structures. Using the same principle behind spider silk, this elasticity enables the device to literally change shapes and configure itself to adapt to the task at hand.</div>\n<div>A folded design would fit easily in a pocket and could lend itself ergonomically to being used as a traditional handset. An unfolded larger design could display more detailed information, and incorporate input devices such as keyboards and touch pads. Even integrated electronics, from interconnects to sensors, could share these flexible properties. Further, utilization of biodegradable materials might make production and recycling of devices easier and ecologically friendly.</div>\n<div><b>• Self-Cleaning: </b>Nanotechnology also can be leveraged to create self-cleaning surfaces on mobile devices, ultimately reducing corrosion, wear and improving longevity. Nanostructured surfaces, such as “Nanoflowers” naturally repel water, dirt, and even fingerprints utilizing effects also seen in natural systems.</div>\n<div><b>• Advanced Power Sources: </b>Nanotechnology holds out the possibility that the surface of a device will become a natural source of energy via a covering of “Nanograss” structures that harvest solar power. At the same time new high energy density storage materials allow batteries to become smaller and thinner, while also quicker to recharge and able to endure more charging cycles.</div>\n<div><b>• Sensing The Environment: </b>Nanosensors would empower users to examine the environment around them in completely new ways, from analyzing air pollution, to gaining insight into bio-chemical traces and processes. New capabilities might be as complex as helping us monitor evolving conditions in the quality of our surroundings, or as simple as knowing if the fruit we are about to enjoy should be washed before we eat it. Our ability to tune into our environment in these ways can help us make key decisions that guide our daily actions and ultimately can enhance our health.</div>\n<div><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2008/02/morph_4.jpg" width="389" height="550" /></div>\n</br>\n<b>How feasible is the technology?</b></br>\n<div>In addition to the above mentioned advantages, the integrated electronics shown in the Morph concept could cost less and include more functionality in a much smaller space, even as interfaces are simplified and usability is enhanced. All of these new capabilities will unleash new applications and services that will allow us to communicate and interact in unprecedented ways.</div>\n<div>Elements of Morph might be available in the market to integrate into handheld devices within 7 years, though initially only at the high-end. However, nanotechnology may one day lead to low cost manufacturing solutions, and offers the possibility of integrating complex functionality at a low price.</div>\n</br>\n<b>Is Nokia working on more such phones/technology?</b></br>\n<div>Nokia Research Center is working on technology up to seven years in the future and creating concepts that challenge conventional practices and spark new innovations.</div>\n</div>\n</div>	t	t	t	0	0	0	&nbsp; What is the Nokia Morph about?

This is a series of articles that will cover various aspects of the problem statement of the autonomous event <a href="http://robotix.in/across">ACROSS</a> and their possible solutions. This particular article will cover the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recursive Backtracker</span></em> algorithm that can be used by a bot to navigate on an 8x8 grid containing obstacles at unknown locations. Note that the article does not cover on how to implement this algorithm in an autonomous robot. That will be covered in future articles. At the end you can also find the link to a software for testing grid solving algorithms.

As an additional constraint, we consider that the arena in unknown to the bot. In other words, when the bot starts moving, it has no knowledge of the location of obstacles on the grid. It knows only its starting position and the required ending position.\n<h2><strong>Location</strong></h2>\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image001.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-580" title="image001" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image001.png" alt="" width="201" height="203" /></a>\n<p align="center">Figure 1 The 8x8 ACROSS Grid</p>\nLet the location of bot at any point be denoted by the 2D coordinate system that is by X and Y coordinates. In the arena shown below, each square denotes one such point. The <em>point (0, 0)</em> is denoted by the <em>top leftmost square</em>.\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image003.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-581" title="image003" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image003.png" alt="" width="203" height="203" /></a>\n<p align="center">Figure 2 The ACROSS Round 1 Arena</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Grey denotes an obstacle in this case raised platforms</li>\n\t<li>Orange denotes the final location in this case a gap between two platforms (3, 3)</li>\n\t<li>Dark Blue denotes the initial location (0, 7)</li>\n\t<li>Light Blue lines will denote the path taken by the robot</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Movements</strong></h2>\nFrom any point on the grid, the bot can move in four directions:\n<ul>\n\t<li>North - (x, y) to (x, y-1)</li>\n\t<li>East - (x, y) to (x+1, y)</li>\n\t<li>West - (x, y) to (x-1, y)</li>\n\t<li>South - (x, y) to (x, y+1)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Algorithm</strong></h2>\nAt each coordinate of the grid, the basic roles of the bot remain the same. As a result we need only one basic function to navigate which can repeatedly called. The roles can be divided into two parts:\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Base Cases:</em> These indicate whether the current location is valid that is whether it is possible to move to it or not. They also indicate if the bot has reached the destination thereby indicating it is time to stop.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Recursive Parts:</em> These scan the four positions in the four directions around the current position to check if any of them satisfy the base cases. In programming terms this involves placing a call to the same function but with a different set of arguments, which in this case correspond to a position. Hence this part is termed as recursive and it is responsible for the robot advancing through the maze.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Recursive Parts</strong></h2>\nLet's start by assuming there is already some algorithm that finds a path from some point in a maze to the goal and call it <em>RecurPath (x, y)</em>.\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image006.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-582 alignleft" style="margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 0px;" title="image006" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image006.png" alt="" width="197" height="197" /></a>Let us assume that the robot managed to reach a point (0, 4) using this function. Now it is required to check all the four directions to find the path ahead. Thus we place four calls:\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>RecurPath (0, 3) - North</em></li>\n\t<li><em>RecurPath (1, 4) - East</em></li>\n\t<li><em>RecurPath (0, 5) – South</em></li>\n\t<li><em><em>RecurPath (-1, 3) - West</em></em></li>\n</ul>\nNote that these checks can be performed in any order. Now since going west will mean going out of the grid, that function call should return something to indicate the same. While rest of the directions are valid and the function should indicate the same.\n\nGeneralizing this, we can call <em>RecurPath ()</em> recursively to move from any location in the maze to adjacent locations. In this way, we move through the maze.\n<h2><strong>Base Cases</strong></h2>\nIt's not enough to recursively advance through the maze. We also need to determine when to stop.\n\nOne such <em>base case</em> is to stop when it <em>reaches the goal</em>.\n\nThe other base cases have to do with moving to invalid positions. For example, we have mentioned how to search North of the current position, but disregarded whether that North position is legal. In order words, we must ask:\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Is the position in the maze</em> (...or did we just go outside its bounds)?</li>\n\t<li><em>Is the position open</em> (...or is it blocked with an obstacle)?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Pseudo-code</strong></h2>\n<pre>RecurPath(x,y) {\n\nMove robot to (x, y)\n\nif (x,y outside maze) return false\n\nif (x,y is goal) return true\n\nif (x,y not open or is marked visited) return false\n\nmark x,y as visited\n\nif (RecurPath(North of x,y) == true) return true\n\nif (RecurPath(East of x,y) == true) return true\nif (RecurPath(South of x,y) == true) return true\nif (RecurPath(West of x,y) == true) return true\n\nMove robot to (x, y)\n\nreturn false\n\n}</pre>\nMarking x,y as visited is necessary to prevent the bot from going around in circles. For the explanation to the last call to <em>Move robot to (x,y) </em>see the Dead Ends section of this post.\n\nTo use to find and mark a path from the start to the goal with our given representation of mazes, we just need to:\n<ol start="1">\n\t<li>Locate the start position (call it <em>startx</em>, <em>starty</em>).</li>\n\t<li>Call <em>RecurPath(startx, starty)</em></li>\n\t<li>Re-mark the start position.</li>\n</ol>\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image008.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-583" title="image008" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image008.png" alt="" width="205" height="205" /></a>\n<p align="center">Figure 4 Sample Run</p>\nYou can verify that each colored square that is part of the final path satisfies one of the ‘if statements’ of the Pseudo-code.  As an example lets see what happens when the bot is at (0, 0):\n\nFirst lets go one step backward to position (0, 1).  At this position:\n<p align="center"><a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image010.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-584" title="image010" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image010.png" alt="" width="205" height="205" /></a></p>\n<p align="center">Figure 5 At position (0, 1)</p>\n\n<pre>RecurPath(0,1) {\n\nMove robot to (x, y)\n\nif (x,y outside maze) return false\n\nif (x,y is goal) return true\n\nif (x,y not open or is marked visited) return false\n\nmark x,y as visited\n\nif (RecurPath(North of x,y) == true) return true  [Highlight 1]\n\nif (RecurPath(East of x,y) == true) return true\nif (RecurPath(South of x,y) == true) return true\nif (RecurPath(West of x,y) == true) return true\n\nMove robot to (x, y)\n\nreturn false\n}</pre>\nSince none of the base cases are satisfied, code reaches the highlighted step, placing a call to <em>RecurPath (0, 0). </em>Note that the call has not yet finished executing.\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image012.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-585" title="image012" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image012.png" alt="" width="205" height="205" /></a>\n<p align="center">Figure 6 At position (0, 0)</p>\n\n<pre>RecurPath(0,0) {\n\nMove robot to (x, y)\n\nif (x,y outside maze) return false\n\nif (x,y is goal) return true\n\nif (x,y not open or is marked visited) return false\n\nmark x,y as visited\n\nif (RecurPath(North of x,y) == true)  return true [Highlight RED]\n\nif (RecurPath(East of x,y) == true) return true [Highlight GREEN]\nif (RecurPath(South of x,y) == true) return true\nif (RecurPath(West of x,y) == true) return true\n\nMove robot to (x, y)\n\nreturn false\n\n}</pre>\nThus the robot moves to (0, 0). Reaches the code highlighted in Red, placing a call to <em>RecurPath(0, -1). </em>This will return false since the point is outside the maze. So the code proceeds to the next step, calling <em>RecurPath(1, 1). </em>Thus the robot moves to (1, 1) and in this manner the sequence keeps going on. The sequence will end only when the robot reaches the goal, that function call will then return true and subsequently all the calls before it<em> </em>will return true as well. Thus the output of our initial call to <em>RecurPath(startx, starty) </em>will be true.\n<h2><strong>Dead Ends and Backtracking</strong></h2>\nSo what happens if the bot takes a wrong turn, a path, which leads to a dead end, or a path, which we know wont reach, the end point? Let us consider this run again:\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image014.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-586" title="image014" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image014.png" alt="" width="203" height="201" /></a>\n<p align="center">Figure 7 At position (5,4)</p>\nNow since the North is blocked so the bot turns to East calling <em>RecurPath(6,4):</em>\n<pre>RecurPath(6,4) {\n\nMove robot to (x, y)\n\nif (x,y outside maze) return false\n\nif (x,y is goal) return true\n\nif (x,y not open or is marked visited) return false\n\nmark x,y as visited\n\nif (RecurPath(North of x,y) == true)  return true [Highlight RED]\n\nif (RecurPath(East of x,y) == true) return true [Highlight RED]\nif (RecurPath(South of x,y) == true) return true [Highlight RED]\nif (RecurPath(West of x,y) == true) return true [Highlight RED]\n\nMove robot to (x, y)\n\nreturn false\n\n}</pre>\nSince all directions are either marked visited or are blocked,<em> Move robot to (6,4).</em> Since the bot is already there the call ends, returning false. Now the code goes back to the previous call <em>RecurPath(5,4)</em> with the bot still at (6,4)\n<pre>RecurPath(5,4) {\n\nMove robot to (x, y)\n\nif (x,y outside maze) return false\n\nif (x,y is goal) return true\n\nif (x,y not open or is marked visited) return false\n\nmark x,y as visited\n\nif (RecurPath(North of x,y) == true)  return true   //Code reaches here\n\nif (RecurPath(East of x,y) == true) return true [Highlight RED]\nif (RecurPath(South of x,y) == true) return true [Highlight RED]\nif (RecurPath(West of x,y) == true) return true [Highlight RED]\n\nMove robot to (x, y)\n\nreturn false\n\n}</pre>\nAgain the code reaches Move robot (5,4) moving the bot from (6,4). In this way the bot backtracks on reaching a dead end.\n<h2><strong>Resources</strong></h2>\nSoftware that demonstrates the above algorithm can be found here <a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MinotaurPathfinder.zip">MinotaurPathfinder</a> Extract the zip file.  You can find more information on how to use in the Readme file contained within.

118	The Google Glass	the-google-glass	2	\N	\N	2013-05-23 19:14:49+05:30	2015-06-24 12:47:06.617346+05:30	Back in early 2012, before the world had heard of Google Glass, the tech world was ablaze with rumours that the search giant was beavering away on augmented reality goggles.\n\nAs the days went by, it was clear that not only was this true, but that Google's dream of wearable technology was far, far closer to release than anyone would have guessed.\n\nRoll forward just over a year and the first versions are in the hands of developers who went into a lottery to fork out $1,500 for their own pair of spectacles.\n\nBut what exactly is Google Glass? Why is it attracting all this attention and what are the implications - both good and bad - of having a Google-eye view of the world?\n\n<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.kurzweilai.net/images/google-glasses.top_.jpg" width="475" height="307" />\n<h3>What is Google Glass?</h3>\nGoogle Glass is an attempt to free data from desktop computers and portable devices like phones and tablets, and place it right in front of your eyes.\n\nEssentially, Google Glass is a camera, display, touchpad, battery and microphone built into spectacle frames so that you can perch a display in your field of vision, film, take pictures, search and translate on the go.\n\nThe principle is one that has been around for years in science fiction, and more recently it's become a slightly clunky reality. In fact, the "heads-up display" putting data in your field of vision became a reality as early as 1900 when the reflector sight was invented.\n\nGoogle Glass uses display technology instead to put data in front (or at least, to the upper right) of your vision courtesy of a prism screen. This is designed to be easily seen without obstructing your view. According to Google the display is "the equivalent of a 25-inch high definition screen from eight feet away". There's no official word on native resolution, but 640 x 360 has been widely mooted.\n\nOverlaying data into your vision has obvious benefits; many of which are already functional in Google Glass. Directions become more intuitive (although it sounds like there is no GPS on board so you will have to pair it with your phone), you can view real-time translations or transcriptions of what is being said, and you can scroll through and reply to messages - all on the fly.\n\n<img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0195/0326/files/google-glass-1_large.jpg?214" width="480" height="320" />\n\nThe embedded camera obviously does not need a viewfinder because it is simply recording your first-person perspective, allowing you to take snaps or footage of what you are actually seeing.\n\nAny function that requires you to look at a screen could be put in front of you.\n\nControlling this data is the next neat trick. With a microphone and touchpad on one arm of the frame, you can select what you want to do with a brief gesture or by talking to the device, and Google Glass will interpret your commands.\n\nGoogle Glass can also provide sound, with bone-induction technology confirmed. This vibrates your skull to create sound, which is both more grisly sounding and much less cumbersome than traditional headphones.\n<h3>What can Google Glass do?</h3>\nAs well as Google's own list of features, the early apps for Google Glass provide a neat glimpse into the potential of the headset.\n\nAs well as photos and film - which require no explanation - you can use the Google hangout software to video conference with your friends and show them what you're looking at.\n\nYou'll also be able to use Google Maps to get directions, although with GPS absent from the spec list, you'll need to tether Glass to your phone.\n\nTo do that, Google offers the MyGlass app. This pairs your headset with an Android phone. As well as sharing GPS data, this means messages can be received, viewed on the display, and answered using the microphone and Google's voice-to-text functionality.\n\nGoogle has given its Glass project a big boost by snapping up voice specialists DNNresearch.\n\n<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Face-Rec.jpg" width="1600" height="901" />\n\nThat functionality will also bring the ability to translate the words being spoken to you into your own language on the display. Obviously you'll need a WiFi connection or a hefty data plan if you're in another country, but it's certainly a neat trick if it works.\n\nThird parties are also already developing some rather cool/scary apps for Google Glass - including one that allows you to identify your friends in a crowd, and another that allows you to dictate an email.\n\nThe New York Times app gives an idea how news will be displayed when it's asked for: a headline, byline, appropriate image and number of hours since the article was published are displayed.\n<h3>How much will Google Glass cost?</h3>\nThe Google Glass Explorer (the developer version being sent out now)costs $1,500 - around £985 or AU$1,449.\n\nThe consumer versions, which are expected to arrive by the end of 2013, are expected to be a little cheaper, although any actual prices remain speculative. They are unlikely to be super-cheap - but Google's success with the Nexus 7 tablet may prompt the company to subsidise some of the cost.\n<h3>When is the Google Glass release date?</h3>\nA final release date has not been announced, but sources tell us that theoriginal suggestion of 2014 was actually overly pessimistic and we could see Google Glass arrive in time for the end of 2013.	t	t	t	0	0	0	Back in early 2012, before the world had heard of Google Glass, the tech world was ablaze with rumours that the search giant was beavering away on augmented reality goggles.

It is designed to study the physics of strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities, where a phase of matter called quark-gluon plasma forms.\n\nAll ordinary matter in today’s universe is made up of atoms. Each atom contains a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons (except hydrogen, which has no neutrons), surrounded by a cloud of electrons. Protons and neutrons are in turn made of quarks bound together by other particles called gluons. No quark has ever been observed in isolation: the quarks, as well as the gluons, seem to be bound permanently together and confined inside composite particles, such as protons and neutrons. This is known as confinement.\n\n<a href="http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/Objects/Chapter1/pA/test6.png"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/Objects/Chapter1/pA/test6.png" width="4096" height="3037" /></a>\n\nCollisions in the LHC generate temperatures more than 100,000 times hotter than the centre of the Sun. For part of each year the LHC provides collisions between lead ions, recreating in the laboratory conditions similar to those just after the big bang. Under these extreme conditions, protons and neutrons "melt", freeing the quarks from their bonds with the gluons. This is quark-gluon plasma. The existence of such a phase and its properties are key issues in the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), for understanding the phenomenon of confinement, and for a physics problem called chiral-symmetry restoration. The ALICE collaboration studies the quark-gluon plasma as it expands and cools, observing how it progressively gives rise to the particles that constitute the matter of our universe today.\n\nThe ALICE collaboration uses the 10,000-tonne ALICE detector – 26 m long, 16 m high, and 16 m wide – to study quark-gluon plasma. The detector sits in a vast cavern 100 m below ground close to the village of St Genis-Pouilly in France, receiving beams from the LHC.\n\nThe collaboration counts more than 1000 scientists from over 100 physics institutes in 30 countries.\n\nSource: CERN	t	t	t	0	0	0	ALICE detects quark-gluon plasma, a state of matter thought to have formed just after the big bang.

We will first learn how to make a mobile robot which is capable of moving according to instructions received from the laptop. Then we will discuss how to navigate the arena of Geo-Aware using an onboard camera, via two modules, lane following and shape detection. Finally, we will see how the map that will be given at the start can be processed to obtain information about the path to be taken, which can then be utilized during the onboard run. We will also discuss some ideas to tackle some harder aspects of the event.\n\nThe above things put together, will help us make a robot that should be able, if programmed properly, to solve the problem statement of Geo-Aware.\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PART 1 – A REMOTE CONTROLLED ROBOT</strong></span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LOCOMOTION</strong></span>\n\nThe robot can be made to move by using a differential drive as the base. With independent motors for the left and right sides of the base, differential drives allow the robot to move in all directions and turn as well. How the motors will rotate will be determined by the voltage supplied to the motor by the motor driver circuit, which in turn will depend on the instructions sent to the motor driver by the microcontrollers.

allows us to control the robot and make it autonomous. By pre-programming it, we can make it give different outputs based on different inputs and instructions received, and thereby the robot acts accordingly. For a more elaborate understanding of the working of an AVR microcontroller, please visit <a href="http://www.robotix.in/tutorials/category/avr/avrprog">here</a>. Essentially you only need to program the microcontroller on your robot, to move in a particular direction, based on the character received by it from the laptop.\n\n<img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KyOrYuwXtukuAW7CwCD0YNtEl91-UbybSXjLu864D3S0tMJmyjyOz8QPJNIwzzDrPISOoMcpBv_pNVKWTkp7W-4palVFyHQOuvkvm8vCGPmXSTSMVBBjc-tbWxbiMK9JkVo" />\n\nFig: The development board for the microcontroller from Robokits\n\nFor the purpose of a demonstration, we will show the sample code for WSAD robot, which basically means a robot that can move forward and back, and turn left and right, when the keys w, s, a and d respectively, are pressed – the basic movements of a differential drive.\n\nThe code to be burnt on your microcontroller can be found<a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7890269"> here.</a>\n\nThe instruction from the microcontroller is sent to the motor driver circuit (assumed to be connected to Port B here), which then sends it to the motors. Please note that you must test which combination of voltages makes the motor rotate in which direction – the bit sequences you send based on the characters received will depend on that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nMMNEn_Hg1jEXl2wW6sUlwvJAYBrhKLnRUuBq1odiF9w8lwDKQhxU1TqL5dcwG9eWLrUmAj9hV0Pv3kzfKI9UdtK0JI2rwxFikTjXsQiykvWiAP9_A9NY_ymPsHQhDVdYW0" />\n\nFig: A schematic diagram of a motor driver circuit\n\n<img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PvK1yUe3c6_XtxLEQ4-pr17zOWaJIbqGivcUaAK1Z3Iiev4eSn2HMJe99de6lAwSddYqfDzbPm5O46eTzgPC3RL-TkDOf0KchcDkrYdn0rBYa3oFd7gvPFLeHXy6h3vI3U8" />\n\nFig: An actual motor driver circuit with an L293D\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SERIAL COMMUNICATION</strong></span>\n\nOnce we have linked our computer to the microcontroller via the connections we discussed earlier, we need to be able to send instructions to it through our code. In our project that we shall use for our Image Processing application in robotics, we have to include files and use certain functions for starting the serial communication device, and then sending data to the microcontroller through the device. We use files that have already been made for this purpose. These are:\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href="http://robotix.in/samplecode/tserial.h">tserial.h</a> – A header file for starting the serial device</li>\n\t<li><a href="http://robotix.in/samplecode/tserial.cpp">tserial.cpp </a>– The C++ program that actually initializes the device</li>\n\t<li><a href="http://robotix.in/samplecode/bot_control.h">bot_control.h</a> – The file which contains the definitions of the functions which shall be used for the purpose of serial communication [send_data(), startDevice(), stopDevice() etc]</li>\n</ul>\nThese files are available for download from our website. After being downloaded, they need to be included in the Visual Studio project you are using. What you need to do is gather all these three files in a directory and add the path of that directory in Project-&gt; Properties-&gt;C/C++-&gt;General-&gt;Additional Include Directories, and apply the changes to the settings. Also, Project-&gt; Properties-&gt;Configuration Properties-&gt;General-&gt;Character set should be changed to Not Set.\n\nAs you can see, all of the above will help you to create a robot that is capable of moving in response to commands that you send to it from the laptop. In Seeker, of course, these commands will have to be sent autonomously from your program. What commands will be sent, will depend on the image processing done by your program on the video feed received. We will discuss how to do that now.\nN.B – All of the above which we accomplished with an AVR microcontroller can also be done through Arduino, another very popular framework for microcontroller programming. Please look<a href="http://www.robotix.in/tutorials"> here</a> for tutorials on general usage and communication using Arduino.\n\nThe program <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7890458">here</a> is a standard one which shows how to send characters through the serial communication device, via the code in your Visual Studio project.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PART 2 – COMPUTER VISION</strong></span>\nBefore proceeding with this module, we would request you to go through the set of general<a href="http://www.robotix.in/tutorials"> tutorials </a>for computer vision, for both MATLAB and OpenCV, also found on our website. It is quite extensive, and we will assume that a working knowledge, as put forward there, is in the grasp of the reader of this tutorial.\n\nThe major sub-tasks that the computer vision will have to take care of are:\nTRAVERSING THE CORRIDOR\n\nThe pictures and the 3D model of the simulated indoor arena give a good idea of what kind of corridors the robot will be traversing.\n\nThe first step would be to reduce the image of the corridor to the essential features. By applying Canny Edge detection and then excluding a certain upper portion of the image, the following transformations can be obtained:\n(The sample coloured image is an estimated view of the corridor in front of the robot, from the 3D model of the arena)\n\n<img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/evxXOnzV7--umOwUW0T1NE_B5tkdpW1OkuIXbKsFtlU4hmVVT5qBJQx7twoqm5KqNvagbSGUqJ_iZPXJa50N6r1tCYB0cyG3kvQ9UOO2AkeEn-_zyOEFF7aUQHc1om1lKzM" />\n\n<img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/l38o7N3GYZb1WMr_2LReqzHROVNy6eVp5G13MRaub_l8HRMQkfoPQCe1q1lmWl0L7oHeQ2uvfRPaKXq1ifoScQGxpOaqoLrLx7BaPzSXMOkt8d6Rp9w7E4XZIfJXVr9v_g0" />\n\n<img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GPpWCd5vpriMOi7F7Bi2_QNX-Ybrob4RdNfMvTuHxslMKc32zP0tu_gZMphebL9GrpE1daTBE3Fa8IWo-Dgf1H51o-LNyls-JX3DjcN4x2snsCUipcvj4V1LidZVpa-vw6I" />\n\nFig: The actual passage; the first transformation to edges; the second transformation after excluding the upper half of the image\n\nAs you can see, the transformations on the image received have made the video feed of the image considerably easier to analyse. Now the corridor essentially consists of two sloping lines on either side of the robot. We can use this information effectively to determine how the robot should move along the corridor.\n\nUsing the angles of the lines\n\nTo successfully implement this, you will need to be comfortable with the Hough Transform for lines, which will need to be implemented on the image. You may refer to our tutorial or to any other on the website for how to do this.\n\nApplying the polar line transform will give you the major lines in the image and their angles, with algebraic sign. Visualising it very simply, one sees that if the sum of the angles of the two major lines is nearly zero, then the robot is placed between the two lines, and in the correct direction. At this point of time, it can move forward. Otherwise the robot must turn accordingly, such that the sum of the slopes becomes zero. A combination of these two techniques should allow the robot to make its way along the corridor while following it.\n\nGiven below is a code snippet which implements this part of the problem statement, in the manner described.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGenerating a middle path\n\nAnother method to understand and follow the lane would also require the use of this type of reduction. Thereafter, it would require the generation of two lines that are parallel to each other and perpendicular (almost) to the direction of the two lines. The transformation is shown here:\n\n<img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QFRlneRIWHZWhucnoHSL44iByOiVbx6rGabK0wIyvSb8QM6gxwm4gsL5XvudL87Jz1KIz8OrXt3kwR4WBimEpZ6imBbd8HGQZl-WfF4feKU6yEFy5wXsZkk_yJ0pl5Gfr-Y" />\n\nThe above transformation can be done simply by taking two pairs of nearly equidistant points on the two lines, and computing their mid-points, and then comparing the relative positions of the mid-points.\nIf the two mid-points are almost along the same vertical line, then the robot is in the correct orientation and should move forward. Otherwise, it should turn accordingly.\n\nThe above two methods can be used to allow the robot to follow a corridor. Now, we go to the next sub-problem to be solved by image processing – that of recognising the signs and symbols.\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SYMBOL RECOGNITION</strong></span>\n\nThe known symbols to be recognized in this event are circles, squares and triangles (there is also a hexagon for round 3 but we won’t discuss that right now). By a process of both elimination and image analysis, we can easily recognize which of them is at the end of a particular corridor, as the robot approaches the symbol.\n\nIt is assumed that the image frame taken from the video feed will be mostly a black background, and the relevant symbol occupying the majority of the frame, coloured blue, green or red. By colour detection, we can find out what that colour is, thereby cutting down the number of possibilities significantly. Of course, our program should have methods to recognise all the symbols, and which are called accordingly based on the colour. (If the participant is using a makeshift overhead camera which the robot is carrying, then the same principle applies, except that the background will be white instead of black)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Contour Matching</strong></span>\n\nThe OpenCV library has a number of methods that allow for good and robust object analysis. One such method uses the concept of contours and polygon approximation. Without going too much into the theory of it, we will see the implementation of that here.\n\nThere is a function called cvFindContours, which when provided with a binary image containing the object, a data structure to store points, and the other appropriate parameters, returns a sequence of contours in the image. Please refer to the documentation of OpenCV to find out how to utilize this function. Once we have obtained the sequence, we can run the function called cvApproxPoly, which takes all the contours and returns the ones which are linked to each other and the corresponding approximate polygon formed by them. Hereafter, we can analyse the successive linked contours.\n\nWe can count the number of vertices obtained and compare them with what we know will be the result for the various signs. This can take care of distinguishing between the various polygons.\n\n<img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_Ng0aIETnTjoA3JSEnWi2F78NC1OMYKnabdo4EY7pJHdHhWDOEzy9v8bgymA7hFfBzqwHln5aJUqYUCPi4U2r-Ltm89Wy_FEi4SPFdP-rLcdnymUG-CCgVxd4AhIBF8ZvBM" />\n\nFig: A sample of how the above method works\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shape Detection</strong></span>\n\nThis method can also prove very useful, either stand-alone or after combining with contour matching. This method also utilizes a variation of the Hough transform to detect what the shape is. The reader is encouraged to go through the algorithm in detail. An excellent treatment of the problem can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:I5ohJpq3uaQJ:citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.59.4239%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf+hough+transform+rectangle&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=in&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiY24FwrJKetVVrvMSecF6pylJQVmjjABEgBxSNSkHYHJf3k0RkNNIFUBs8Zz2JpDWA285M2n1crQ6qYH5PT6ZskxxG3eXKcAm3PFAL3l8vuaxCogsb7wJ8dE6mjs_7IMFkewsU&amp;sig=AHIEtbTl4Xs69MCdAq3uX-K2f2kR8QfW3A">here</a>.\n\nThe basic principle is reducing the image of the shape to simply the outer edge, by using a combination of colour detection, edge detection and blob labelling. Thus, we can obtain the approximate centroid of the figure. After that we can plot the distance of pixels versus the angle taken. If there are roughly four maxima, that indicates a rectangular figure; three maxima indicate a triangular figure and the absence of maxima indicates a circle.\n\nAnother method is to plot the distance of edge pixels from the centre versus the frequency of that distance – the presence of a single spike would indicate a circle. This method would be effective for only a circle however.\n\nThe sample code provided here is used for detecting circles using the above algorithm.\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MAP PROCESSING</strong></span>\n\nAs mentioned in the problem statement, the map provided to you at the start will be a generated image which is a representation of an overhead view of the arena. The image will be a created image instead of a real one, as maps normally are. Have a look at an example map here:\n\n<img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u9WoP1Y3etsoFctA0GZu88hSeqIFepTFHPzjP2JgpsrRqsx8741JV0ic0lELPJehAhazUgB7K9SwVl0scogi06H15Vf97fOd0QemGumXRTsoamHwKBsFUV049d40na9A8qM" />\n\nFig: The yellow and brown patches represent start and end zones\n\nAs you may have guessed, the modules of the previous parts do not mean much for Geo-Aware by themselves, until they are tied in with the map processing. For instance, your robot might be able to traverse the corridors well, but when it comes across a symbol at the end of the corridor; it will not be able to understand the significance of the symbol until it can correlate it with the map. Even if it can take the L-turn properly using simply lane following, when it comes across a T-junction, in the absence of a map it would have to make a guess about which turn to take, which could very well lead to a dead end and a penalty.\n\nThe method we will describe can work decently well for Rounds 1 and 2, and the concept of it can be extended for Round 3, although we won’t discuss that as such. Furthermore, whatever we discuss here is merely meant to be a platform, a base upon which you can build your own ideas or concepts and solve it in your own way.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Waypoints</strong></span>\n\nThese are important locations around the arena that a robot will reach. When connected in a proper sequence, they trace the path of the robot in order. For this particular purpose, we will consider waypoints such that the robot travels in straight lines between successive waypoints, and each waypoint requires it to perform some specific action (turn, start or stop) before moving on to the next one.\n\nSome obvious candidates for waypoints are the locations of the symbols. They appear just in front of turns in the arena, and they represent portions of the arena that are accessible. The start and ending zone patches will also be waypoints, albeit special ones. However that is not all. If you look at the previous figure of the map, the red circle and green triangle are not directly connected (same for the blue circle and blue triangle). To do so, we will need to define another kind of waypoint – the location in front of the T-junction.\n\nTherefore our task now becomes to observe the map from above, determine specific waypoints and put them in correct sequence from the start zone to end zone. If we can do this, then we can trace the path of the robot across the arena and use that to correlate what the robot sees onboard with the overhead map.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Obtaining Waypoints</strong></span>\n\nBefore we look into how we can do this, we will need two reduced images that will help us in this purpose. I have illustrated them below and I leave the task of obtaining them to you.\n\n<img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MeysDzeyTkIvuQbHjwY_FiBJ3ubhpFZ0cmACpmQNfHB41SuKdjbbIR0CuvfRavOjQDoV8QO8Cl-eXFCsbxTdd5Ay7TUaT-OACgtS6bM-Q5VpXapn3PMqMsM3uSRthz9TeHg" />\n\nFig: This represents the total accessible area of the arena, without focussing on symbols. We will call this the ‘Path Image’\n\n<img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2-XOih4I9aMrF2CVc-4OYaIOuviHSZLUO5CKCzxLWJf3pSr2qV_pkDQrEiyHUhsT8iiQlqfRwpRX4gismFdSRrgXJbdatpJMrbOL2NSQoSdw-4eelwwNW3jFHRYoklxuXv0" />\n\nFig: This represents all the landmarks in the arena, including start and end patches. They will be needed to get waypoints. We’ll call this the ‘Landmarks Image’\nOnce again, at this juncture, I’ll assume you have read our detailed computer vision tutorials so that you understand the terms and processes that I will mention below. The general algorithm is simple and can be applied to any such map:\n\nObtain the ‘Path Image’ and ‘Landmarks Image’ for the given map (you can of course assume the colours are standard BGR combinations)\n\nPerform blob detection on ‘Landmarks Image’ to get a set of blobs, their colours, centroid etc.\n\nPerform shape detection on each of the blobs (except start and end patches) to get their shapes. Now you can uniquely identify each symbol.\n\nIdentify which blobs are directly reachable from each other. By that I mean that the line segment joining the centres of the two blobs, when taken in ‘Path Image’ should pass through white (accessible) areas only. (You can use Bresenham’s line tracing algorithm or just use LineIterator in OpenCV to iterate over the line joining two points in an image)\n\nTry and link blobs in sequence. Begin from the start point, find out which blob is connected to it (there will be only one), and link it to the path, then find out which not-yet-linked blob is connected to this, and so on. You will come across a barrier when you consider a blob before a T-junction (the red circle in this case).\n\nThe last main challenge is getting way-points for a T-junction. As you may have noticed, there will be no symbols for T-junctions. One way to get around that is by understanding that the T-junction waypoint will be directly reachable from the end of the sequence you currently have, and one of the yet unlinked blobs. With that concept, you can drop rays from the current end and the various other blobs and find out which of them intersect to form a waypoint. (The implementation is actually very simple; we leave that to you to figure out from the image below)\n\n<img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/h0sezIumpfftjT4ZuZT2S9Mwsxwls0zeGoRORrLHMFslFsdCyg3egxV6llLt6rZVf6PUjgPomgCdDF7QWnM30z4rg--IuoOHtoI1qidC69YzasJgzRDNxuoHbsrjQoo8P1c" />\n\nFig: A way to generate T-junction waypoints (others are shown too)\n\nAnd that is essentially it! Once you have all the waypoints in a proper sequence, you can easily find out what turns need to be made where (by comparing the nature of the co-ordinates of successive waypoints). For example, you could have a sequence like this:\n\nStraight from Start -&gt; Right at Red Circle -&gt; Right at T-Junction -&gt; Left at Green Triangle -&gt; Left at Blue Circle -&gt; Right at T-junction -&gt; Right at Blue Triangle -&gt; Straight to Finish\n\nAn example of that is given below:\n\n<img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/u45jTrann543B0iJ_Ka0VeuxfmK2E64hvphHJd0cNZYHWmtA7s4q2sfdpJiaLexYO80h3eMlUgwzaomQHkgpE1bqd_lhG8OTlvrWy-VRFnVzE8gSRfNxyL1zqfRW3ymQcMk" />\n\nFig: Obtained after processing this map – the numbers represent the co-ordinates of each waypoint in the image (taking upper left corner as origin) and the directions are self-evident. This captures everything we have discussed above\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>COMBINING THE MODULES</strong></span>\n\nNow that you have made your individual modules, the last challenge is to put all of them together. We leave that as a problem to you, since that is the true essence of this problem statement. You may have your lane following and symbol recognition modules, but the task of knowing which to use when is still dependent on your vision and creativity. Your usage of the map and the sequence of waypoints you have to make decisions about turns will determine how your robot moves.\n\nYour robot will start out following the lane but will soon come up against a sign – the transition needs to be managed carefully. You may use sensors to check for its distance from the wall but an innovative solution with image processing would be really desirable. Again, when it turns, you need to place good checks to know when it has to start looking out for the lane once again.\n\nFurthermore, once you detect the symbol on the wall in front of you, you will have to correlate it with the blobs from the map to locate your position in the map. You can choose not to do this and just use the sequence of turns that you identified, every time you reach the end of a corridor, but that will make your program less robust and more prone to failure, especially if it accidentally hits the wall or changes state.\n\nOnce you have made your robot and your program, try testing it on makeshift arenas with your own maps. Even if that cannot happen, do not worry, we will give you ample time to practice here. Just get started and stay motivated and let us know if we can help! Happy robot-making!\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>APPENDIX – HARDER ASPECTS</strong></span>\n\nThere are some more difficult aspects to the event that some of you may feel particularly challenged by. Since they are not essential to solving the problem statement as such, but rather for obtaining bonus points and boosting your score, we won’t be elaborating upon them in detail but rather providing some ideas you can try out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TUNNELS</strong></span>\n\nRounds 2 and 3 will have tunnels in the arena. They will be shortcuts through inaccessible areas that will not be visible from above but will exist in the arena, and, if taken correctly, can greatly reduce the time you spend in the run. Look at the two images Round 2 tab of our event <a href="http://www.robotix.in/events/event/geoaware">here</a> to spot the tunnel and understand how it will appear.\n\nThis is where the idea at the end of the previous section becomes important. If you map out your path before the run and simply have your robot follow it without any real-time correlation, it will miss the tunnel entirely as it will have no reason to consider its existence.\n\nHowever, if you keep checking for symbols at every junction, and correlating them with your map, you stand a better chance at spotting a tunnel. How exactly you’ll do this is up to you, but understand this general idea that when you expect to see the end of a corridor or a wall or something, and instead you see a path there, chances are you’ve come across a tunnel.\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>VARIABLE START POINTS</strong></span>\n\nAs you may have read, a major difference between Round 3 and its predecessors is the presence of multiple start points. There is also the issue of multiple target zones (red octagons which can be visited en route to the exit for more points) but that is just an extension of the ideas of Round 1 and 2 and if you’ve understood those, you can easily implement that here.\n\nThe variable start points can pose a bigger problem. Remember that there will still be one end zone, but you do not know where you might start. When you get the map, there will be no start zone as such to process. You could perhaps assume a number of start points for various possible locations, and map the paths to the various targets and the end zone from each of these hypothetical start points. Then, once you begin, go forward, reach your first landmark, compare it with your map and find out which of those hypothetical paths you are on, and then traverse that for the rest of the run (also looking for tunnels as you do).\n\nAnother possibility is to do nothing with the map before the run – let the robot start and reach its first landmark. Once it has done so, then try and localize the robot in the map and move ahead accordingly. There are a number of other ways you could handle this – we’ll leave that to you.\n\nYou can discuss your doubts regarding this event at our Geo Aware Forum\n\nTutorials for Image Processing can be found<a href="http://www.robotix.in/tutorials"> here </a>(using OpenCV &amp; MATLAB).\n\n&nbsp;	t	t	t	0	0	0	[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX6BVEVYhwI&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PLzio60ZRzGwaeVf2SNIxYydbsrQzOY7zp&amp;index=8[/youtube] Video Sections: 00:38 - Module 1.0 - Overview 03:12 - Module 2.0 - Hardware: A Remote Controlled Robot 16:32 - Module 3.0 - Lane Following 25:14 - Module 3.1 - Shape Detection 30:37 - Module 3.2 - Map Processing 45:13 - Module 3.3 - Extra Hints 57:00 - Summary...		f		f		zinnia/_entry_detail.html	entry_detail.html			156

Robotix currently sees the biggest participation amongst all such events in the country, and registered over 600 teams this year, with a total of more than 2000 participants .It comprised of 6 events: 2 manual events, 2 autonomous events, a computer vision event and a coding event .</p>\n<img class="wp-image-1298 alignleft" style="height: 40%; width: 40%; border: 0px;" alt="Canyon Rush-nav" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Canyon-Rush-nav.png" width="1000" height="923" />\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="wp-image-1296 aligncenter" style="height: 40%; width: 40%; border: 0px;" alt="InspiralOn-nav" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/InspiralOn-nav.png" width="1000" height="923" /></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">The two manual events were Canyon Rush and InspiralOn. With a combined participation of more than 400 teams, the events were instant favourites among the participants and the audience alike. Canyon Rush was an event in which the robot had to traverse between two parallel walls similar to a canyon and pick up blocks depicting victims and place them at safe zones. It simulated a canyon rescue mission. The event attracted participants in masses, with the total number of teams exceeding 250. The other event, InspiralOn, required the robot to traverse a helical pipe like arena, popping corks and folding checkpoints in its way. It simulated an underground pipe traversal situation. It attracted over 150 teams, despite the challenging problem statement that was put forward.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Tremors-nav.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1299" style="height: 40%; width: 40%; border: 0px;" alt="Tremors-nav" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Tremors-nav.png" width="1000" height="923" /></a><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1300" style="height: 40%; width: 40%; border: 0px;" alt="Transporter-nav" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Transporter-nav.png" width="1000" height="923" /></p>\nThe two autonomous events were Tremors and Transporter. Tremors introduced vibration sensing, and the robot had to avoid ‘earthquake’(vibration) zones while switching off the light sources. The event saw participation of over 100 teams, which is quite rare a number for an autonomous event in a robotics fest in India. The event Transporter required the robot to traverse a grid, pick up blocks and drop them in appropriate zones. Despite the difficulty level, the event saw over 60 teams participating, which was quite an impressive number.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Geo-Aware-nav.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1301" style="height: 40%; width: 40%; border: 0px;" alt="Geo Aware-nav" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Geo-Aware-nav.png" width="1000" height="923" /></a></p>\nGeo Aware, the computer vision event, required the robot to identify symbols and solve a maze, taking the turns by matching them with an overhead image of the arena. The event saw a participation of 30 teams.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SudoCode.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1348" style="height: 40%; width: 40%; border: 0px;" alt="SudoCode" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SudoCode.png" width="1000" height="923" /></a></p>\nSudocode, the online coding event, was present in an all new version this time. With multiple problem statements covering path planning, image processing and natural language processing, the event was in a bigger and better form. The event had submissions from 30 teams from all over the country.\n\nAll in all, upon looking back at Robotix ’14, one might say that Technology Robotix Society has once again achieved its goal of spreading the culture of robotics in the country. The logically impeccable code segments, the unorthodox, yet mind-blowing mechanisms, and the almost insane genius displayed by the participants at Robotix ’14 is a testament to that.\n\nRobotix 2014, surpassing the indomitable!	t	t	t	0	0	0	ROBOTIX 2014, conducted during Kshitij, IIT Kharagpur’s annual technical fest, was a compendium of unique events designed to push the thinking abilities of the participants to a new level altogether!

The result is a flexible robofish can execute escape maneuvers just as quickly as a real fish can — turning its body in a mere 100 milliseconds.\n\n<center><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BSA_zb1ajes" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>Roboticists have been working on durable flexible robots for years now, mimicking real animals. The earthworm like robots, which can withstand hammer blows, and octopus like robots, which can squeeze themselves into small spaces, are examples of this.\n\nThe newly revealed robot belongs to a long line of fish-inspired creations, including RoboTuna, an underwater automaton with 2,843 parts controlled by six motors that came out of MIT in 1994.\n\nSince the new fish robot is self-contained, it does need some hard parts inside its soft body. The "brains" of the fish, or all of its rigid pieces of hardware, are stored at the head, while the robot's lower half and tail are more pliable, the researchers explained. The team used a 3D printer to make the molds for casting the fish's silicone rubber parts.\n\nIn addition to greater flexibility and durability than their rigid counterparts, soft robots may be safer for humans.\n\nThere is at least one practical drawback to the robot in its current iteration: It exhausts its supply of carbon dioxide gas after just 20 or 30 escape maneuvers. The researchers hope a next-generation version of the fish will be able to swim for a half-hour straight, using pumped water instead of carbon dioxide to inflate the channels.\n\n&nbsp;	t	t	t	0	0	0	Robot fish could one day be enlisted for undercover science missions.

It's the latest in a line of biologically-inspired underwater robots developed within the naro (nautical robots) project at ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), which has previously developed robots based on tuna fish and sea turtles.\n\nStefan Bertschi, who leads a school outreach program to promote young talent and raise awareness of the university's programs, approached the naro team with the idea of an edutainment robot based on the tuna fish robot they had developed. Fast forward 4 months and the prototypes were swimming in a pool thanks to financial backing from SATW (the Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences) and the naro team's expertise.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Children aged 10 to 18 can experiment with different fin shapes, sizes, and placements to ..." src="http://images.gizmag.com/gallery_lrg/naro-nanin-robot-fish-4.jpg" width="770" height="577" /></p>\n"Our goal is to teach students different skills in the areas of biology, mathematics, physics, and computer science," explains Cédric Siegenthaler, Project Leader of the naro (nautical robot) team at ETH Zurich. "They learn by playing and by combinations of scientific, technical, design, and artistic components. Depending on the age and level of the kids, naro-nanins can be configured with fins or fully open for kids that want to program the motion parameters themselves."\n\nThe naro-nanin's body consists of an anodized aluminum frame surrounding a polycarbonate tube. Inside, a plexiglass structure contains a Raspberry Pi running Linux and ROS as its main controller, a Li-Po battery that lasts about 2 hours, and a pump that fills a diving cylinder. The whole package weighs 7 kg (15 lb) and is 50 cm (19.6 in) long.\n\nThe kit comes with a set of fins, but students are encouraged to make their own. Different "species" can be created by changing the size and shape of the fins and placing them anywhere on the robot's body. The fins are connected to four attachable actuator modules that contain two standard Hitec servo motors (for flapping and fin rotation). These, and playful decorations, can be freely positioned along the aluminum frames using Lego Technic connectors.\n\nStudents can experiment and see how fin size, shape, and placement on the robot's body affect its speed and control. For example, they'll quickly learn that if the robot's weight isn't balanced correctly it will have difficulty swimming properly. And they'll learn about buoyancy and gravity, and how certain species of fish use a swimming bladder to dive and control depth. They can also hold competitions to see which design swims the fastest or is the most agile.\n\nA pressure sensor detects the robot's depth, while an inertial measurement unit senses and returns its pose to an Android app. A camera module is currently in the works that will allow you to see from its perspective, making underwater navigation easier. Currently the robot is remotely-controlled using a Bluetooth game pad, but once the Android app is completed, multiple robots will be controlled with tablets that communicate via a wireless base station at the pool.\n\n"Unfortunately, Switzerland is not blessed with ocean access and thus does not have a strong industry interested in ROVs [remotely-operated vehicles, such as the Giant Crabster] or AUVs [autonomous underwater vehicles, such as Grace]," says Siegenthaler. "We are searching for possible supporters and investors. But for now, we build the naro-nanins for schools and we pursue research projects with naro-tartaruga."\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Students are encouraged to design their own robot fish with the naro-nanin edutainment pro..." src="http://images.gizmag.com/gallery_lrg/naro-nanin-robot-fish.jpg" width="770" height="577" /></p>\nIf there's demand, the project could be commercialized. The naro-nanin robot could cost as little as US$2,000 to $2,500 depending on what is included in the final specs, and its production costs. Naro's other projects, like the naro-tartaruga, are working towards autonomy and may help the local police to detect objects at the bottom of lakes.	t	t	t	0	0	0	A new breed of robot fish that is both relatively inexpensive and highly customizable is teaching students between the ages of 10 and 18 about technology and biology.

The sensors suitable for this purpose are LED-LDR sensor, or IR LED-Photodiode sensor pair.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Click <a href="http://www.robotix.in/tutorials/category/kraig/1.2">here</a> to understand the basics of these sensor pairs.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Now, let us see how it’ll help to differentiate the line from the surface. We know the fact that a white surface will anytime reflect more rays than a black surface. This is the basic principle that we use to judge whether the sensor pair is on white line or black line.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Consider this LED-LDR sensor pair.</p>\n<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://learning.media.mit.edu/projects/gogo/documents/images/light_reflective_LED_LDR.jpg" width="299" height="178" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">Now, when this sensor pair is on a white line,</p>\n<p dir="ltr">=&gt; more led light reflected by the surface</p>\n<p dir="ltr">=&gt; more light falls on LDR</p>\n<p dir="ltr">=&gt; lesser LDR resistance</p>\n<p dir="ltr">=&gt; the voltage across LDR will be less</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr">Similarly, when the sensor pair is on a black line,</p>\n<p dir="ltr"> =&gt; the voltage across LDR will be high.</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr">Similarly,  for the IR LED-Photodiode sensor pair,</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sensor.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020" alt="sensor" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sensor.jpg" width="215" height="249" /></a></p>\n<p dir="ltr">The voltage across the IR Photodiode will vary as per the intensity of light falling on it.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">More the reflected light, lesser the voltage across ir receiver.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Here is your sensor circuit:</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sensor.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006" alt="sensor" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sensor.png" width="163" height="219" /></a></p>\n<p dir="ltr">The 10k component is your potentiometer which you might have to set to the maximum range. This resistance, ideally should be near ( R(light) * R(dark) )^1/2 where, R(light) is the approximate resistance of LDR during light and R(dark) is the resistance of the same in dark.</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Comparator Circuit</strong></span></p>\n<p dir="ltr">Now for analysing the sensor output, we use a comparator to get a digital output.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Click <a href="http://www.robotix.in/tutorials/category/kraig/1.2">here</a> to understand the basics of comparators.</p>\n<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/op-amp-ckt.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1007 aligncenter" alt="op amp ckt" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/op-amp-ckt.png" width="299" height="228" /></a></p>\n<p dir="ltr">Now, the LED-LDR is connected to a comparator LM358. LM358 is an operational amplifier IC which is being used as a comparator. The non inverting terminal of op-amp (The + terminal) reads the voltage across resistor R4. And, the inverting terminal of op-amp (The - terminal) reads the voltage that has been set at the potentiometer.</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr">When on white line, V(ldr) less =&gt; V(R4) more.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">When on black line, V(ldr) more =&gt; V(R4) less.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">The voltage of at potentiometer (- terminal), V(pot) is such that :</p>\n<p dir="ltr">V(R4)white &gt; V(pot) &gt; V(R4)black</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Such a voltage is set be setting up the corresponding potentiometer resistance.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Hence, now</p>\n<p dir="ltr">When sensor on white line :</p>\n<p dir="ltr">V(R4)white &gt; V(pot)</p>\n<p dir="ltr">=&gt; V+ &gt; V-</p>\n<p dir="ltr">=&gt; Op-amp output = High</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr">When sensor on black line :</p>\n<p dir="ltr">V(pot) &gt; V(R4)black</p>\n<p dir="ltr">=&gt; V- &gt; V+</p>\n<p dir="ltr">=&gt; Op-amp output = Low</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr">This is how we know whether the sensor is on black or white line.</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr">So, if one end of the motor is connected to 12 V and the other end is connected to the Op-amp output, you’ll be able to run the motor or stall the motor depending on which surface your sensor(LED-LDR pair) is.</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr">When white,</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Potentials across motor : 12-12</p>\n<p dir="ltr">=&gt; stall condition</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr">When black,</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Potentials across motor : 12-0</p>\n<p dir="ltr">=&gt; motor runs</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Now, how do we implement this on our line follower?</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr">In this tutorial, we’ll be making a 2 sensor line follower which will be working as - <img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zfYodcIU0p_agqyGhRL8KhCHwcPRy0UCw_B8Nc9Nqe30JjqVS-K5gsr1uIhjW7QCZzG409tO_7esb3mIhIzWCaC83fw7OtA7eY4qu6CEWaIyDgw8zf_RUns7" width="697px;" height="271px;" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">For the turns, we have one motor stalled and other running.</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr">Here is the complete line follower circuit:<img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/H7NXjDC9gyNnMQkHY4Q4IEtI78DaM_vdlgoOR_PRmg7_AjtbrLHxjS6BZcMbg29gAKyVwq38-qA83vBJXeC_26gyfFme35MFDAvoeOpLbAtU_SvZCDQgs_ZB" width="525px;" height="403px;" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">Here, we have both the sensor and the op-amp circuit at 12 V Vcc .

How do they do it?\n\nAnd could we create a robot capable of doing the same?\n\nThat's the question that's been buzzing around Harvard professor Robert Wood's head for 12 years now. And finally, after years of testing and the invention of an all-new manufacturing technique inspired by children's pop-up books, Wood and his team at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University have created a robot the size of a penny that is capable of remote-controlled flight.\n\nYou'd think that the smaller something is, the easier it'd be to make. But there's a point at which making things smaller becomes harder rather than easier, which is why making a functional fly-sized robot has proved such a challenge.\n\nThe so-called RoboBee flaps its wings approximately 120 times per second, almost faster than the eye can track, and is capable of hovering and flying horizontally in multiple directions like a helicopter.\n\nAt 80 milligrams, which is less than one-twentieth the weight of a dime, the robot is so small that traditional components of flight-capable machines simply wouldn't work, so the team had to create new ones.\n\n"Large robots can run on electromagnetic motors, but at this small scale, you have to come up with an alternative, and there wasn't one," Kevin Ma, a co-lead author and graduate student at Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, said in a statement.\n\nIn place of electromagnetic motors, ceramic strips that can expand or contract when hit with an electric field are used, a technique known as piezoelectricity.\n\nThe problem of building these parts at a fly-sized scale was also an enormous obstacle. For example, the robot has no onboard power source — instead, it receives electricity via a thin wire connected to an external battery.\n\nThe solution  to this is a groundbreaking technique that involves layering and folding sheets of carbon fiber, brass, ceramic and other materials, and then using extremely precise lasers to cut these sheets into structures and circuits. After that, the sheets can be assembled into extremely small but entirely functional devices in a single movement, just like a children's pop-up book.  \n\n	t	t	t	0	0	0	Flies have tiny wings and even tinier brains, yet they are capable of flying swiftly and agilely through even turbulent air.

The number of freshers who turned up for the workshop was good, and all were ready to embrace the challenge of making their first line follower. However, what was different about this line follower was the fact that it did not require a microcontroller, as most traditionally do, to carry out its function, but rather it used a sensor circuit and an Op-Amp(Operational Amplifier) - BJT(Bi-polar Junction Transistor) circuit. This different approach of making a line follower was deemed the best method for implementing the same, for the freshers, at this stage, mainly taking into consideration its simplicity.</p>\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2.jpg"><img alt="2" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2-1024x768.jpg" width="1024" height="768" /></a>\n<p dir="ltr">      The freshers were divided into groups based on their knowledge and awareness of the procedures involved. Based on this categorisation, there were primarily three groups, one for those who didn’t know soldering, one for those who knew soldering but had no idea of the circuits, and the third one for those who had some idea of the same. There were mentors suitably allotted to each of the three groups, who ensured that the freshers, at each and every stage, maintained their enthusiasm and understood everything. The freshers were told to implement each circuit the moment it was taught to them, and then move on to the next circuit. The freshers had also made groups among themselves, wherein each group would collectively work on a line follower.

The contest, while seemingly primitive at the time, has since led to vast improvements in robotic technology, and has demonstrated the value of competitions as a way to drive innovation and collaboration among scientists and engineers.\n\nThe DARPA Grand Challenge was designed to foster and accelerate the development of autonomous vehicles that could one day be used to transport cargo and other military supplies into combat zones without endangering the lives of human drivers, according agency officials. The contest was also DARPA's first major attempt to use prize money as an incentive for innovation within the research community.\n\n<strong>Legacy of the Grand Challenge</strong>\n\nAs part of the DARPA Grand Challenge, the first team to pass a series of qualification tests and complete the course in less than 10 hours would win the $1 million top prize.\n\nBut, the contest revealed an industry in its infancy, because none of the cars managed to finish the rugged desert course. In fact, the highest-scoring vehicle traveled only 7.5 miles (12 km), and none of the teams claimed the $1 million prize.\n\nYet, the DARPA Grand Challenge proved to be an important milestone.\n\n"That first competition created a community of innovators, engineers, students, programmers, off-road racers, backyard mechanics, inventors and dreamers who came together to make history by trying to solve a tough technical problems," Lt. Col. Scott Wadle, DARPA's liaison to the U.S. Marine Corps, said in a statement. "The fresh thinking they brought was the spark that has triggered major advances in the development of autonomous robotic ground vehicle technology in the years since," Wadle said.\n\nDARPA's second Grand Challenge was held in the fall of 2005, with 195 teams vying for a $2 million prize. This time, five vehicles successfully completed the 132-mile (212 km) course across southern Nevada.\n\nA team from Stanford University claimed the top prize, after their car "Stanley" finished the course with a time of 6 hours and 53 minutes, DARPA officials said.\n\nIn 2007, DARPA kicked off its third competition, the Urban Challenge. The contest involved driverless cars trying to maneuver through a complex course in Victorville, Calif., demonstrating the ability to manage obstacles and other moving traffic while simultaneously obeying the state's traffic regulations, DARPA officials said.\n\nSix of the 11 teams completed the course, and a team from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh won the $2 million prize.\n\n<strong>Foundation for the future</strong>\n\nThe challenges have helped foster new and useful technologies for the military, including an autonomous utility vehicle used by the Marine Corps that was developed by one of the six finishers of the Urban Challenge, according to DARPA officials.\n\nThe contests have also provided a model for other similar prize-based competitions, including the Spectrum Challenge, which involves teams competing to demonstrate how best to use reliable radio communication amid interfering signals.\n\nIn December, DARPA also held its Robotics Challenge Trials in Homestead, Fla. The contest is designed to advance robotic technology in an effort to design machines that could someday work alongside humans in the aftermath of natural or man-made catastrophes, DARPA officials have said.\n\nA Google-owned Japanese robotics team, named SCHAFT Inc., claimed first place in the Trials, and the highest-scoring teams are now preparing for the third and final phase of the competition, the DARPA Robotics Finals.	t	t	t	0	0	0	The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the arm of the U.S. Department of Defense responsible for advancing military technology, is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the DARPA Grand Challenge, an ambitious, first-of-its-kind race between robotic, self-driving cars.

This can be understood by understanding that the algorithm is essentially a search algorithm designed to locate the destination point anywhere on a grid with obstacles and thus it will check every point on the grid. So if the bot is given only the starting point, it will go to all points on the grid and return back to the start and when that happens we can program it to stop.\nNow we know if we have stored all the points that the bot has visited, these will indicate open positions on the grid and the remaining points will become the points containing obstacles (in this case platforms that provide the path for the upper bot).\n\n<strong>Shortest Path Algorithm:</strong>\nThere are quite a few algorithms that can be used to find the shortest paths in a maze or a grid. The common thing among them all is that a map of the grid is required beforehand. One such popular algorithm is the Dijkstra’s Algorithm. The algorithm basically finds the shortest number of steps between each node of the grid and the starting point.\n\n<strong>Pseudo-Code</strong> (<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.5290293078869581">in C#):</strong>\n\nThe following function runs several passes through the given map and stores the shortest distance of each node from the starting point.\n<pre>void Pathfind(starting point)\n{\n\n    int heroX = startingPoint.X;\n    int heroY = startingPoint.Y;\n    if (heroX == -1 || heroY == -1)\n    {\n return;\n    }\n    // Hero starts at distance of 0.\n    _squares[heroX, heroY].DistanceSteps = 0;\n\n    while (true)\n    {\n bool madeProgress = false;\n\n // Look at each node on the grid.

Now it is required to check all the four directions. This point is at 3 steps away from the starting point so now (0, 3) (1, 4) and (0, 5) will be 4 steps away from the starting point. This will be stored in the corresponding distance steps variables of the points\nNote that the ending point is not required anywhere in this function as the code finds the least number of steps required to reach any node on the grid from the designated starting point.\nThe above function continuously scans the grid until all squares have been marked with the lowest distances from the starting point. When that happens madeProgress variable remains false and the program exits from the loop.\n\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Runs of the Pathfinder loop through the map look something like this : </span></strong>\n\n[caption id="attachment_674" align="alignleft" width="203" caption="First pass through the map"]<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ACROSS-Grid-1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-674 " title="ACROSS Grid 1" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ACROSS-Grid-1.png" alt="" width="203" height="203" /></a>[/caption]\n\n[caption id="attachment_672" align="alignleft" width="203" caption="Second Pass"]<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ACROSS-Grid-2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-672 " title="ACROSS Grid 2" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ACROSS-Grid-2.png" alt="" width="203" height="203" /></a>[/caption]\n\n[caption id="attachment_673" align="alignleft" width="203" caption="Third Pass"]<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ACROSS-Grid-3.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-673 " title="ACROSS Grid 3" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ACROSS-Grid-3.png" alt="" width="203" height="203" /></a>[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; clear: both;">Marking the path from start to finish requires another function :</span></strong>\n<pre>private void HighlightPath(ending point)\n{\n\n    int pointX = endingPoint.X;\n    int pointY = endingPoint.Y;\n    if (pointX == -1 &amp;&amp; pointY == -1)\n    {\n return;\n    }\n\n    while (true)\n    {\n // Look through each direction and find the square\n // with the lowest number of steps marked.\n Point lowestPoint;\n int lowest = 100; //A default value to compare distances with\n\n foreach (Point movePoint in ValidMoves(pointX, pointY))\n {\n//Find the surrounding square with least value of distance steps\n    int count = _squares[movePoint.X, movePoint.Y].DistanceSteps;\n    if (count &lt; lowest)\n    {\n lowest = count;\n lowestPoint.X = movePoint.X;\n lowestPoint.Y = movePoint.Y;\n    }\n }\n if (lowest != 100)\n {\n    // Mark the square as part of the path if it is the lowest\n    // number.

You may consider using the following approach:\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Robotic Arm &amp; Hook Mechanism</span><strong>:</strong>\nThe victims are kept on the base of the crevasses .In order to lift the victims, the robot should have an extension mechanism or a flexible arm to accomplish the required task. Think about using a hook to lift the bridging parts (Joints) and victims.\n\nYour robot can have a flexible arm to lift victims kept at the base of the crevasse. The movement of the arm can be controlled either by using motors or by hydraulics (using liquid<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_power"> fluid power</a> to do simple work)\n\nA mechanical arm is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic">robotic</a>, with similar functions to a human <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm">arm</a>. The arms  are controlled by DC motors.The pictures below show a pretty good description of the working of this mechanism.\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC3503.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-699" title="_DSC3503" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC3503-1024x678.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="423" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe have used two 10 rpm motors in the robotic arm. The total length of the arm is around 40 cms, long enough to pick up the victims.

The same code however can be easily modified for a grid with obstacles. An arduino code file is provided at the end.\n\n<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2ZF_rrBzaLk" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe>\n\n<strong>Materials Used</strong>\n\nArduino Leonardo\nLine follower Hardware (Sensors, Motor drivers, Bot Chasis etc.)\nLCD Display (for Debugging purposes)\n\n<strong>The Concept</strong>\n\nFrom previous articles we know that the position of the bot on a grid is described by x and y coordinates. Grid following on a grid without obstacles is based on the assumption that a robot can reach any point on the grid if it is able to reach any point lying along the x or y axis from the current position. Now, we know that the movement along x or y axis from the current position will correspond to movement in any of the 4 directions (N, S, W, E). The fact that these directions remain fixed with respect to the grid, even when the orientation of the bot changes, is utilized to take the robot from one point to any other.\n\n<strong>How to Proceed?</strong>\n\nThe building of a grid follower requires a working line follower bot. To detect intersections efficiently we place two additional LED-LDR sensors in addition to the three line following ones. After achieving line following, the bot is made capable of detecting intersections and then turning 90 and 180 degrees at them. Now we move on to the code that will allow the bot to navigate from one point to any other point. For this, firstly a (0, 0) point is fixed on the grid. 4 directions (say N, S, E, W) are fixed with respect to the grid. The code keeps a record of the bots current position as well as its current direction.\n\n<strong>Functions</strong>\n<pre>void line_follow()\n{\n  int left = ReadSensor(A1, 0, 0);\n  int middle = ReadSensor(A2, 4, 0);\n  int right = ReadSensor(A3, 8, 0);\n  int exleft = ReadSensor(A0, 0, 1);\n  int exright = ReadSensor(A4, 4, 1);\nif(middle < s2 && left >s1 && right >s3)\n{\n  lcd.setCursor(13,0);\n  lcd.print("For");\n  forward();\n}\nelse if(left < s1 && right > s3 && middle > s2)\n{\n  lcd.setCursor(13,0);\n  lcd.print("Lef");\n  turn_left();\n}\nelse if(right < s3 && middle > s2 && left > s1)\n{\n  lcd.setCursor(13,0);\n  lcd.print("Rig");\n  turn_right();\n}\nelse if(exleft < s0)\n{\n  lcd.setCursor(13,0);\n  lcd.print("ELe");\n  turn_left();\n}\nelse if(exright < s4)\n{\n  lcd.setCursor(13,0);\n  lcd.print("ELe");\n  turn_right();\n}\n}</pre>\nBefore we start making a grid follower, a line follower is required. In the above code 5 LED-LDR sensors are used for this purpose.\n\n<strong>Detecting intersections and Moving Forward</strong>\n\nTo update its current position, our bot is required to detect grid intersections while moving forward. Intersections refer to intersection of white lines on the A.C.R.O.S.S grid while moving forward refers to moving in the same direction that the bot is currently facing.\n<pre>void grid_forward(int count)\n{\n  int temp=0;\n  while(1)\n  {\n  int exleft = ReadSensor(A0, 0, 1);\n  int exright = ReadSensor(A4, 4, 1);\n  if(exleft < s0 && exright < s4)\n    {\n//Intersection detected\n       stopp();\n       delay(1000);\n       temp++; //Increase the value of temp variable which holds the value of number of intersections crossed\n\n       lcd.setCursor(8,1);\n  lcd.print(temp);\n  if(temp==count)\n  {\n//Bot stops on reaching required number of intersections\n     stopp();\n     return;\n  }\nelse\n{\n  forward();\n  delay(1000);\n}\n    }\n  line_follow();\n  }\n}</pre>\nThe above function moves the bot forward for a certain number of node intersections. The number of intersections are indicated when a call is placed to the function. An intersection is detected when the extreme left and extreme right LDR sensors are both on the line. The bot stops when the value of temp variable becomes equal to count. In all other cases the bot stops for a while at the intersection, increments temp variable and moves forward.\n\n<strong>Turning at Intersections</strong>\n<pre>void grid_right()\n{\n  forward();//Code reaches here when bot is stopped at an intersection\n  delay(1000);\n  right_90(); //Bot moves a bit forward from the intersection and then turns at 0 radius\n  delay(2000);\n  while(ReadSensor(A0, 0, 1)&gt;=s0)\n  right_90();  //Keep turning till the extreme left sensor is on the line\n  if(dir=='N')\n  dir='E';\n  else if(dir=='E')\n  dir='S';\n  else if(dir=='S')\n  dir='W';\n  else if(dir=='W')\n  dir='N';\n}\nvoid grid_left()\n{\n  forward();  //Code reaches here when bot is stopped at an intersection\n  delay(1000);\n  left_90();//Bot moves a bit forward from the intersection and then turns at 0 radius\n  delay(2000);\n  while(ReadSensor(A4, 0, 1)>=s4)\n  left_90(); //Keep turning till the extreme right sensor is on the line\n  if(dir=='N')\n  dir='W';\n   else if(dir=='E')\n  dir='N';\n  else if(dir=='S')\n  dir='E';\n  else if(dir=='W')\n  dir='S';}\n\nvoid uturn()\n{\n  grid_right();\n  right_90();\n  delay(2000);\n  while(ReadSensor(A0, 0, 1)>=s0)\n  right_90();\n  if(dir=='N')\n  dir='E';\n  else if(dir=='E')\n  dir='S';\n  else if(dir=='S')\n  dir='W';\n  else if(dir=='W')\n  dir='N';\n}</pre>\n<strong>Declaring and fixing grid constants</strong>\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image0051.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-727 alignleft" title="image005" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image0051.png" alt="" width="247" height="247" /></a><a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image007.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-728 alignleft" title="image007" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image007.png" alt="" width="170" height="186" /></a>\n\n(0, 0) is fixed at lower left corner and directions according to the picture on the right. Thus positive y direction corresponds to N.\n<pre>int cx=0, cy=0; //The current coordinates of the bot\nint dir = ‘N’ ; //The current direction</pre>\nPlease note that the bot has to start always at the designated coordinates and directions declared above\n\n<strong>Updating The Directions</strong>\n\nThe bots direction changes only on turning. The new direction depends on the direction of the turn and the current direction that the bot is facing. For example in the 90-degree right turn code above:\n<pre> if(dir=='N')\n  dir='E';\n  else if(dir=='E')\n  dir='S';\n  else if(dir=='S')\n  dir='W';\n  else if(dir=='W')\n  dir='N';</pre>\nThis part of the code take the bot from one point to any other point lying along the x or y direction. For example from (0, 1) to (2, 1) that is along the positive x direction or from the (0, 1) to (0, 5) along the positive y direction. Let (dx, dy) correspond to the destination and (cx, cy) correspond to the current position. Now we have 4 cases:\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Positive X direction</strong> - Destination point has an x-coordinate that is of a higher value than the current x-coordinate</li>\n\n\t<li><strong>Negative X direction</strong></li>\n\n\t<li><strong>Positive Y direction</strong></li>\n\n\t<li><strong>Negative Y direction</strong></li>\n\n</ul>\nLet us look at the first case in detail. Now the bot is supposed to move in the positive x-direction from its current position. Now depending on which direction the bot is facing currently, we have 4 more cases:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Facing North:</strong> Thus the bot should take a right turn from current position and move the required number of steps</li>\n\n\t<li><strong>Facing South:</strong> The bot should take a left turn from the current direction and move the required steps</li>\n\n\t<li><strong>Facing West:</strong> The bot should take a u-turn and move the required number of steps</li>\n\n\t<li><strong>Facing East:</strong> The bot should simply move forward since it is already facing the positive x-direction</li>\n</ul>\n\n\nSimilarly we can form the other 4 cases. This has been done below:\n<pre>void move_robot(int dx, int dy)\n{\n  if(dx-cx>0 && dy-cy==0)\n  { //Move along positive x-axis\n    if(dir=='N')\n    {\n      grid_right();\n      grid_forward(dx-cx);\n       }\n    else if(dir=='E')\n    {\n      grid_forward(dx-cx);\n    }\n    else if(dir=='S')\n    {\n      grid_left();\n      grid_forward(dx-cx);\n    }\n    else if(dir=='W')\n    {\n      uturn();\n      grid_forward(dx-cx);\n    }\n    cx+=dx-cx;;  \n    lcd.setCursor(10,1);\n    lcd.print(dir);\n    lcd.setCursor(12,1);\n    lcd.print(cx); \n    lcd.setCursor(14,1);\n    lcd.print(cy); \n \n  }\n  \n      \n  if(dx-cx==0 && dy-cy>0)\n  {//Move along positive y-axis\n    \n    if(dir=='N')\n    {\n      grid_forward(dy-cy);\n    }\n    else if(dir=='E')\n    {\n      grid_left();\n      grid_forward(dy-cy);\n    }\n    else if(dir=='W')\n    {\n      grid_right();\n      grid_forward(dy-cy);\n    }\n    else if(dir=='S')\n    {\n      uturn();\n      grid_forward(dy-cy);\n    }\n    cy+=dy-cy;\n    lcd.setCursor(10,1);\n    lcd.print(dir); \n    lcd.setCursor(12,1);\n    lcd.print(cx); \n    lcd.setCursor(14,1);\n    lcd.print(cy); \n \n  }\n  if(dx-cx<0 && dy-cy==0)\n  {//Move along negative x-axis\n    \n    if(dir=='N')\n    {\n      grid_left();\n      grid_forward(cx-dx);\n       }\n    else if(dir=='S')\n    {\n      grid_right();\n      grid_forward(cx-dx);\n    }\n    else if(dir=='W')\n    {\n      grid_forward(cx-dx);\n    }\n    else if(dir=='E')\n    {\n      uturn();\n      grid_forward(cx-dx);\n    }\n    cx-=cx-dx;\n    lcd.setCursor(10,1);\n    lcd.print(dir); \n    lcd.setCursor(12,1);\n    lcd.print(cx); \n    lcd.setCursor(14,1);\n    lcd.print(cy); \n \n  }\n  if(dx-cx==0 && dy-cy<0)\n  {//Move along negative y-axis\n    \n    if(dir=='W')\n    {\n      grid_left();\n      grid_forward(cy-dy);\n       }\n    else if(dir=='E')\n    {\n      grid_right();\n      grid_forward(cy-dy);\n    }\n    else if(dir=='S')\n    {\n      grid_forward(cy-dy);\n    }\n    else if(dir=='N')\n    {\n      uturn();\n      grid_forward(cy-dy);\n    }\n   cy-=cy-dy;\n  lcd.setCursor(10,1);\n  lcd.print(dir); \n  lcd.setCursor(12,1);\n  lcd.print(cx); \n  lcd.setCursor(14,1);\n  lcd.print(cy); \n \n  }</pre>\n<strong>Moving to a General Point</strong>\n\nNow that we can move along x and y axis, moving diagonally to any point on the grid is possible. For this we simply move the required number of steps in the x direction first then move the required steps in the y direction. It can be vice-versa also.\n<pre>\nvoid move_general(int gx, int gy)\n{\n  move_robot(gx, cy);\n  move_robot(gx,gy);\n  return;\n}\n</pre>\n\n\n<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>\n\nSince the recursive backtracker algorithm requires the bot to move one step at a time and that too along the axis, we can easily implement it using the above code and an additional obstacle sensor. The only change would be to check if the node in front is free using the obstacle sensor, before the bot tries to move to it.\nFor the Arduino code file, click <a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/sketch_jan05a.ino_.zip">sketch_jan05a.ino</a>\nFor doubts, suggestions and feedback send a mail to aditya@robotix.in	t	t	t	0	0	0	Introduction This tutorial covers the navigation of an autonomous bot on a grid without obstacles.

Now engineers at Brown University have built a robot inspired by the bat.\n\nIt doesn’t fly on its own yet – the robo-bat is still attached to a kind of arm in a wind tunnel. It does, however, mimic the wing shape and motion of the lesser dog-faced fruit bat. The robot itself is linked to a device called a force transducer, which records the amount of energy needed to move the wings and the aerodynamic forces on their structure.\n\nBesides understanding how bats fly, data collected from experiments with the robo-bat could tell engineers how to design small robots that flap a pair of wings instead of fly with propellers or rotors.\n\nThe robot, about eight inches long, has bones of plastic, made on a 3-D printer, that are the same proportions as those in real bats. The skin is made of silicone. The joints are bent by tiny motors that pull on cables, which function similarly to tendons.\n\nScientists and engineers study bird and bat flight because it is actually a pretty complicated process. While flapping wings provide lift, they also push the animal down as they move up. They also don’t move in a simple up-and-down motion, since they have to provide thrust as well. Preliminary results from the robo-bat show that the folding of wings on the upstroke reduces the force of air pushing downwards by 50 percent.\n\nBat wings themselves are complex structures. Unlike bird wings they cover a big part of the length of the body. Also, they are webbing supported by analogues to finger bones rather than the feathers that birds use. The skin that makes up the wings is so strong it can stretch to four times its length without tearing.\n\nThe robot isn’t a perfect simulation (yet), but it can still tell scientists a lot. For example, when they tested the first versions, they found that certain joints suffered more damage than others. That showed where the stress occurs in real animals and why their ligaments are located where they are, as well as their muscular structure.\n\nThe experiments with the robot appear in the journal Bioinspiration and Biomimetics. Joseph Bahlman, a graduate student at Brown, led the project, working in the lab of professors Kenneth Breuer and Sharon Swartz, who have studied the anatomy of bats and their flight characteristics.\n\nvia <a href="http://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2013/02/robobat">Brown University</a>	t	t	t	0	0	0	&nbsp; &nbsp; We’ve had robots inspired by cheetahs, sand fleas, geckos and birds.

An brain-controlled exoskeleton that moves a patient’s legs could be one way to get some patients out of wheelchairs.\n\nA multinational consortium led by Belgian company Space Applications Services has designed the mindwalker, which is a frame — the exoskeleton — that attaches to the torso and legs and moves them as the wearer thinks about it.\n\nUnlike a bionic limb, the exoskeleton doesn’t need to be linked with electrodes inside the body. Instead, it uses a simple cap that reads electrical signals from the brain. When the wearer thinks of moving, a certain pattern appears, which is interpreted by a computer as a signal to move.\n\nThe Mindwalker design uses a “dry” cap, which doesn’t need special gels to boost electrical conductivity, so it is much more convenient to use than “wet” caps often used to study brain activity.\n\n<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/blogs/dnews-files-2013-03-Mindwalker-3-jpg.jpg" />\n\nThis concept is a bit different from the Ekso system, which works by registering shifts in weight, or the powered exoskeletons built for military use such as the Human Universal Load Carrier, which assist movement in people who have full use of their limbs. And unlike bionic limb designs, the Mindwalker bypasses the spinal cord and nerves — there’s no need for attaching electrodes inside the body.\n\nOne challenge has been getting clean signals from the brain and using them to refine the gait of the device. Most walking robots are designed with a gait that doesn’t bear much resemblance to a human. And typically, robotic legs aren’t good at re-balancing if pushed.\n\nMindwalker’s software allows it to cope with that, somewhat, but Michel Ilzkovitz, systems and ground segment engineering Manager at Space Applicatons, told Discovery News that although able-bodied people can balance, people with spinal cord injuries will still need a set of crutches.\n\nIt’s also built to be lighter, and thus easier to move. It’s still heavy, at 70 pounds, but that’s a lot lighter than many early designs.\n\nIt also requires training. The cap is looking for a certain set of signals, but they are hard to pick up amid the noise, and they differ slightly between people. Mindwalker wearers must learn how to make their brains give a “clean” signal, so they need to practice using it in a virtual-reality setting.\n\nThe Mindwalker has been tested with able-bodied users, and hrogh May of this year volunteers with spinal cord injuries will try it out.\n\n<i>Credit: Mindwalker</i>	t	t	t	0	0	0	Thousands of people every year suffer spinal cord injuries and lose their ability to walk.

They took pictures. We chatted," Kim told AFP via Beam on Tuesday, recalling the walk back to the Hyatt the night before with Suitable Technologies CEO Scott Hassan, the only Beam team member physically at SXSW.\n\n"You don't see a robot walking and navigating itself every day. It's kind of fun" -- although Kim acknowledged, that once at the hotel, Hassan "obviously had to help me press buttons for the elevator."\n\nFewer than 100 Beams have been made since manufacturing began in California in November, and they don't come cheap -- $16,000 each, or the price of a compact car in the United States, plus $3,200 for service and support.\n\nBut Hassan, part of the team that developed a search engine at Stanford University that came to be known as Google, sees big potential for the useful gadget that stands a humanly five feet two inches (1.57 meters) tall.\n\n"Basically any time you need to have a face-to-face meeting with someone, or where physicality is important, you can substitute a Beam for it and then you can be there," he said.\n\nAll that's required is an internet or mobile data connection. The Beam itself is battery powered and comes with a custom docking station.\n\nSo in lieu of traveling half-way around the world, a designer in New York or London, for instance, can use a Beam to zip around a factory floor in China to inspect an assembly line in real time and talk to colleagues on the spot.\n\nSurgeons in one place can similarly take their place alongside colleagues in a hospital operating theater in another, lending their observations and expertise to those actually wielding the scapels.\n\n"We think this is a good way to lower health costs all around the world," said Hassan, adding that Beam is working on a new model with a high-definition zoom camera especially suited for precise medical applications.\n\nIn time, depending on demand, "we might build a unit for the consumer market," he said, raising the prospect of using a Beam to go to a family reunion without, er, actually going.\n\nBasketball legend turned tech tycoon Shaquille O'Neal came up with yet another mission for Beam when he discovered it at SXSW over the weekend and expressed interest in supporting the venture.\n\nSource: <a href="http://news.discovery.com/tech/robotics/robot-lets-you-be-two-places-once-130313.htm">Discovery news</a>	t	t	t	0	0	0	After a long day at the South by Southwest (SXSW) interactive trade show, Susie Kim and her colleagues took a leisurely two-block stroll back to their hotel in downtown Austin.

Well, that convenience could be a reality soon as robots will make life more comfortable for humans by performing tasks that humans find repetitive or at times even unsafe. \n\nThis observation was made by Surendranath Reddy, founder of Redd Robotics, while speaking at a session titled 'Robots, Internet of Things and the Future' at Goa Project 2013. Reddy said while there was still some way to go before the dawn of the advanced and complex robots seen in sci-fi movies, such robots will be a possibility in the future. He felt "it may even be possible to create robots which are capable of emotions since emotions are caused by a mixture of chemicals." \n\n<img src="http://www.newscientist.com/blog/technology/uploaded_images/iCat-752244.jpg" width="1600" height="1266" class="alignnone" />\n\nReddy said the field of robotics is still in the beginning stages, and that it will witness 'big and awesome innovation' soon with home automation being part of this. He said the International Space Station has one of the most advanced robots to have been developed so far. \n\nCiting robotic soldiers and the US drones used to kill terror targets, he lamented that science fiction writer Issac Asimov's laws for robots which state that robots will never harm or kill humans, even in self-defence; and that they will always obey humans unless ordered to harm another human were not being followed any more. \n\nSpeaking about the 'Internet of Things', he said "more and more devices and small pieces of hardware (such as sensors) collecting information are now connected to the internet"- which itself has evolved at an exponential speed - and that the year 2013 had been named the year of the Internet of Things. \n\nHe pointed out that consumers are now able to purchase items like smart shoes which can measure fitness parameters such as distance and terrain covered, time taken among other factors and upload these details to the internet so that they can be collated and the users can observe the patterns of their fitness regime. \n\nHe cited an estimate that by 2020, more than 50 billion devices will be connected to the internet equivalent to about roughly six devices per human.	t	t	t	0	0	0	PERNEM: Ever wonder how convenient life would be if the often tiresome tasks like cleaning your home could be completely automated.

Now MIT researchers have built a humanoid robot with a special motion-tracking system and spring-loaded actuators that make it better equipped to deal with household chores. The robot, named Domo, can size up an object by shaking it in its hand and then put it away in a cupboard.\n\n“Demographics are changing, particularly in Japan, Europe, and the U.S.,” says Aaron Edsinger, a lead researcher on the Domo project and a postdoctoral student at MIT’s computer-science and artificial-intelligence lab. “There are a lot of people that are getting older and not a lot of young people to take care of them.”\n\nBut developing a multipurpose robot for the elderly hasn’t been easy because the home environment is so unpredictable. Industrial robots, which are widely used in manufacturing, work with parts that come in standard shapes and sizes. Food, however, does not. So a simple task such as putting away groceries can become quite complicated.\n\nDomo takes that variability into account. Instead of preprogramming the robot so that it only knows how to deal with cans and boxes with certain dimensions, Edsinger has Domo size up each item–one at a time–before deciding how it should be stored.\n\nThe shelving process begins when a human puts an item in one of the robot’s hands. The robot then determines the object’s dimensions based on grip and video analysis. First, the robot wiggles the object in its hand while video cameras in the robot’s head record the movement. The robot knows how much force it applied with the wiggle, so it knows how much the object it’s holding should move. Using special motion-capture software, Domo finds the object in the video that moves as predicted and assumes it is the item in its hand.\n\nNow that the robot has identified the item to be shelved, Domo must determine its shape and size. If it’s a small object that fits in the robot’s hand, it can determine the object’s size based on its grip. For long objects, the robot must perform more video analysis.\n\n<a href="http://img.mit.edu/newsoffice/images/article_images/200908311112514822.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://img.mit.edu/newsoffice/images/article_images/200908311112514822.jpg" width="404" height="303" /></a>\n\nKnowing that the tip of a long object will wiggle quicker than the rest, the software isolates the part of the object moving the fastest and considers it to be the point farthest away from the robot’s hand. Once the robot knows the object’s dimensions, it can determine how best to place it in the cupboard. “If it’s a pack of spaghetti, it will lay it on its side instead of trying to stand it upright,” Edsinger says.\n\nThis might seem like a trivial task, but that’s largely because humans tend to underestimate the complexity of their daily activities. Identifying and placing objects requires a lot of different processes. The beauty of Domo is that it’s a very integrated system and can handle many processes at once. That’s why Domo can handle the unexpected; the same algorithm that works for a water bottle will work for a box of spaghetti.\n\nDomo can also perform basic insertion tasks, such as placing a spoon in a bowl, and help with tidying up the house by carrying around a box in which the human can put clutter. “I can hand it a box of any size, and it can hold it between its two hands, track me, and keep the box nearby,” Edsinger says.\n\nDomo, which was created for research purposes, will probably never make it onto store shelves–or into anyone’s kitchen. But the research that goes into Domo will likely be used by other roboticists in their quest to create the ideal domestic robot. For example, a robot’s ability to find the tip of an object is extremely helpful for scientists developing robots that can work with household tools.\n\nIllah Nourbakhsh, a robotics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, is impressed with the special springs incorporated into Domo’s actuators. These springs, known as series elastic actuators, can be found in 22 of the robot’s 29 joints. The actuators let the robot know how much force is applied by an external object and act as shock absorbers if the robot hits something. By making the system tolerant to bumps, it’s safer for both the robot and the human. “In a car assembly plant, you have sensors around the robots so people can never get near them,” Nourbakhsh says. But with a home-care robot, the situation is quite different: one wants the human and the robot to be able to work in close quarters.\n\nHowever, whether a humanoid machine remains the best robotic solution to elder care remains controversial. Sebastian Thrun, director of Stanford’s artificial-intelligence lab, questions whether it’s necessary for the robot to resemble a human. “It’s a great project, but by going to a humanoid form, the problem becomes harder than it needs to be,” Thurn says. A robot arm mounted to a cabinet might be a simpler solution to the grocery problem, for example.\n\nNourbakhsh agrees. “The problem is [that] making a general-purpose robot with a human form is extremely expensive,” he says. If the humanoid is mobile, then power requirements also become a problem. Nourbakhsh says that existing batteries don’t run for long enough to handle routine housework. He says he envisions a future elder-care system in which the robots are incorporated into standard appliances, such as stoves and refrigerators, so that they “disappear into the world around you.”\n\n&nbsp;	t	t	t	0	0	0	For more than a decade, roboticists have worked on systems for the elderly, hoping to extend the amount of time that seniors can live at home and improve their quality of life.

Based on the signals obtained, the power unit is controlled to move the joint in unison with the wearer's muscle movement, enabling HAL to support the wearer's daily activities. This is what we call a 'voluntary control system' that provides movement interpreting the wearer's intention from the biosignals in advance of the actual movement. Not only a 'voluntary control system' "HAL" has, but also a 'robotic autonomous control system' that provides human-like movement based on a robotic system which integrally work together with the 'autonomous control system'.

It was started in Sep ’09 with a motive to create awareness against poor energy management practices, to drive sustainability in the burgeoning Indian market, and elevate the Indian industry to the standards and expectations of a developed nation in the new era.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://ecozensolutions.com/images/mcs.png" width="440" height="265" /></p>\nEcozen recently designed a pioneering and innovative micro-cold storage product that is powered by solar energy. In India alone, 10 million tons of cold storage capacity is required to prevent the over 30% wastage of perishable produce. The current facilities are accessible only to the big farmers/middlemen who hoard when supplies peak, leading to huge price fluctuations. The bottom of the pyramid (BOP) i.e. the small farmer loses out, as they have to sell their produce at very low prices right after harvest.\n\nThe product primarily designed for the rural segment serves their needs ideally, as it does not depend on grid electricity and after a 2-year breakeven, leads to over 40% increase in their profits. This innovative product can be suitably adapted for local conditions across the world.\n\n"The farmer has to take this produce from his farm to the mandi, that's the market," Ecozen cofounder Devendra Gupta said from India, via Skype. "So crops that are sensitive to temperature, they need to be transported in a refrigerated transport. That is very costly. If the farmer has a refrigerated transport of his own, he can save a lot of those costs."\n\nThe Ecozen team developed a portable, higher efficiency cold storage unit with photovoltaic panels that could be fitted onto a vehicle the size of a U-haul truck. That reduces the cooling load, unlike building-sized cold storage facilities. Individual farmers might not be able to invest in one, but the team envisions groups of farmers buying a micro cold storage unit as a community.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSource : <a title="Ecozen" href="http://ecozensolutions.com/" target="_blank">Ecozen</a>	t	t	t	0	0	0	Ecozen Solutions is a start up of IIT Kharagpur graduates focused at providing energy and environment solutions to businesses in India.

Or it could inject a micro RFID tracking device under your skin." While DNA-sucking, RFID-chip-injecting mosquito drones are currently a bunch of bunk, a Bing image search shows a multitude of MAVs that aren't simply CGI mockups.\n\nThis little MAV had a 3 centimeter wingspan and that was back in 2007. When the U.S. government was accused of making insect spy drones in 2007, Tom Ehrhard, a retired Air Force colonel and expert on unmanned aerial craft, told the Telegraph, "America can be pretty sneaky." The article also mentioned a dragonfly drone the CIA had developed in the 1970s.\n\nWhile reading people's comments concerning spy drones flying overhead, there have been many comments about "skeet shooting" drones down from the sky. <em>That</em> would most likely be destroying government property and make a person a "terrorist." Besides, would you really see a tiny part bot, part bug "cyborg insect" drone from a distance if it was spying on you?\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. Air Force showed off bug-sized spies as "tiny as bumblebees" that would not be detected when flying into buildings to "photograph, record, and even attack insurgents and terrorists."\n\n<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.networkworld.com/community/files/user13712/Fly_drone.jpg" width="180" height="108" />\n\nMany flying insect drones were developed into prototypes that year, but look again at the fly drone that could fit on the tip of your finger. Gizmo Insider suggested, "We've heard of a fly swatter, but what about a marksman trying to shoot down every fly he sees within a 100 yard radius. The future of warfare and intelligence collection just got a whole lot more sophisticated." That was five years ago, so what insect spy drones exist now that the public doesn't know about?\n\nThe MAV Ornithopter on the left, so-called "lethal mini drones," were being developed outside of Dayton, Ohio, and were set to roll-out by 2015.\n\nLockheed Martin's Intelligent Robotics Laboratories unveiled "maple-seed-like" drones called Samarai that also mimic nature. U.S. troops could throw them like a boomrang to see real-time images of what's around the next corner, the Navy Times reported. It could also be "useful for the military and police" to look inside buildings. But nano-biomimicry MAV design has long been studied by DARPA. DARPA's 2008 symposium discussed "bugs, bots, borgs and bio-weapons." The Pentagon's "cyborg moth" is now defunct tech and bat drone bots are also old surveillance news. Researchers have developed bio-inspired drones with bug eyes, bat ears, bird wings, and even honeybee-like hairs to sense biological, chemical and nuclear weapons.\n\nThe future of hard-to-detect drone surveillance <em>will</em> mimic nature. The dragonfly "insect spy" drone is old, but bug-sized microdrones with flapping wings are still considered the future. The U.S. is not alone in miniaturizing drones that imitate nature; France has flapping wing bio-inspired microdrones [PDF] and the Netherlands BioMAV (Biologically Inspired A.I. for Micro Aerial Vehicles) developed a Parrot AR Drone last year; it's now available in the USAas a "flying video game" toy. DARPA's Hummingbird Nano Air Vehicle (NAV) was named by Time Magazine as one of the best 50 inventions of 2011.<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.networkworld.com/community/files/user13712/AeroVironment_hummingbird_drone_for_DARPA.jpg" width="250" height="170" />\n\nJohn Hopkins University said in February 2012 that "butterfly research will aid the development of flying bug-size robots" and showed off this "insect-inspired flapping-wing MAV under development at Harvard University."That looks a great deal like the "fly drone" yet again, only this time compared to a penny. Are they commonly used and we just don't know it? The Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the National Science Foundation funded the insect flight dynamics research, so John Hopkins reseachers have turned to studying even smaller MAV bugs like fruit flies.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania GRASP Lab showed offdrones that swarm, a network of 20 nano quadrotors flying in synchronized formations. Engadget called them "four-bladed aerial ninjas," but theSWARMS goal is to combine swarm technology with bio-inspired drones to operate "with little or no direct human supervision" in "dynamic, resource-constrained, adversarial environments."	t	t	t	1	0	0	Alan Lovejoy wrote, "A device like this could be controlled from a great distance and is equipped with a camera, microphone.

While NASA's X1 robotic exoskeleton can't do what you see in the movies, the latest robotic, space technology, spinoff derived from NASA's Robonaut 2 project may someday help astronauts stay healthier in space with the added benefit of assisting paraplegics in walking here on Earth.\n\n<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/696246main_jsc2012e064813_alt_1600_946-710.jpg" width="946" height="710" />\n\nNASA and The Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) of Pensacola, Fla., with the help of engineers from Oceaneering Space Systems of Houston, have jointly developed a robotic exoskeleton called X1. The 57-pound device is a robot that a human could wear over his or her body either to assist or inhibit movement in leg joints.\n\nIn the inhibit mode, the robotic device would be used as an in-space exercise machine to supply resistance against leg movement. The same technology could be used in reverse on the ground, potentially helping some individuals walk for the first time.\n\nWorn over the legs with a harness that reaches up the back and around the shoulders, X1 has 10 degrees of freedom, or joints -- four motorized joints at the hips and the knees, and six passive joints that allow for sidestepping, turning and pointing, and flexing a foot. There also are multiple adjustment points, allowing the X1 to be used in many different ways.\n\n<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/images/ER4/X1-Video-Release.jpg" width="1916" height="1092" />\n\nX1 currently is in a research and development phase, where the primary focus is design, evaluation and improvement of the technology. NASA is examining the potential for the X1 as an exercise device to improve crew health both aboard the space station and during future long-duration missions to an asteroid or Mars. Without taking up valuable space or weight during missions, X1 could replicate common crew exercises, which are vital to keeping astronauts healthy in microgravity. In addition, the device has the ability to measure, record and stream back, in real-time, data to flight controllers on Earth, giving doctors better feedback on the impact of the crew's exercise regimen.\n\n<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/1821ko4xlzahujpg/original.jpg" width="640" height="360" />\n\nAs the technology matures, X1 also could provide a robotic power boost to astronauts as they work on the surface of distant planetary bodies. Coupled with a spacesuit, X1 could provide additional force when needed during surface exploration, improving the ability to walk in a reduced gravity environment, providing even more bang for its small bulk.\n\nHere on Earth, IHMC is interested in developing and using X1 as an assistive walking device. By combining NASA technology and walking algorithms developed at IHMC, X1 has the potential to produce high torques to allow for assisted walking over varied terrain, as well as stair climbing. Preliminary studies using X1 for this purpose have already started at IHMC.\n\nThe potential of X1 extends to other applications, including rehabilitation, gait modification and offloading large amounts of weight from the wearer. Preliminary studies by IHMC have shown X1 to be more comfortable, easier to adjust, and easier to put on than previous exoskeleton devices. Researchers plan on improving on the X1 design, adding more active joints to areas such as the ankle and hip, which will, in turn, increase the potential uses for the device.\n\nSource: <a href="http://www.nasa.gov">NASA</a>	t	t	t	0	0	0	NASA's Ironman-Like Exoskeleton Could Give Astronauts, Paraplegics Improved Mobility and Strength.

127	Giant Swarms of Wi-Fi Robots	giant-swarms-of-wi-fi-robots	2	\N	\N	2013-07-07 19:35:44+05:30	2015-06-24 12:47:09.83006+05:30	It’s a scenario straight out a sci-fi B-movie: giant self-organized robotic swarms bearing Internet access, setting up pop-up wi-fi networks during a natural disaster. Scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology have developed such a technology, using flying robots that could swarm over an area and provide Internet access to disaster response teams and citizens on the ground. The breakdown of communications infrastructure is one of primary challenges responders contend with in times of crisis, meaning that the technology could be serve as an essential lifeline. SciDev.net reports:\n<p>A fleet of vehicles would hover above a disaster zone with a module in the wing of each robot emitting a wireless signal to enable communication between rescuers. Each vehicle is made from lightweight, flexible polypropylene plastic, weighs less than half a kilogram and has a wing span of 80 centimetres. A battery-powered motor enables each vehicle to fly for up to half an hour before visiting a recharging station. The team is preparing a paper describing how it flew 10 robots — enough to establish and autonomously maintain a 1.5-kilometre communication line — to link up two rescuers on the ground.\n\n<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://popupcity.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Robotic-Wi-Fi-swarm-2.jpg" width="540" height="344" /></p>\nAnother potential utility for these wi-fi robot swarms is to provide decentralized Internet access in situations where a regime has shut down Internet access, as happened in Egypt. Joop DeBoer at PopUp City notes that “in conflict situations such as in Libya, the ‘allied forces’ could use a robotic swarm to empower the insurgents with the ability to communicate properly. Imagine a swarm circling above the Tahrir Square in Cairo to enable Facebook and Twitter communication as soon as Mubarak has cut off Internet.”\n\nIn a fantastic yet fascinating scenario, speculative architecture blog Pruned imagines how the concept could be deployed in other situations using a significantly lower-tech solution than robots. Pruned posits a strange future of ‘cyborg’ wi-fi-bearing birds:\n<p>...instead of hovering over disaster and conflict areas, how about urban and rural dead zones or in even more remote locales? And instead of drones and toy airplanes, you conscript pigeons, starlings and other flying weeds into a wi-fi network of cyborg fauna? ...One imagines urban homesteaders converting a water tank into an aviary for their robo-starlings, next to their urban apiaries, urban chicken coops and urban farming tool shed. When they need to communicate with other urban homesteaders, either nearby or in another Detroit-like ruin pornscape, they only need to open the hatch. It's an artisanal wi-fi for networked off-grid living.</p>\nVia PopUp City	t	t	t	0	0	0	It’s a scenario straight out a sci-fi B-movie: giant self-organized robotic swarms bearing Internet access, setting up pop-up wi-fi networks during a natural disaster.

At 6’2? (188cm) and 330lbs (150kg), Atlas is incredibly imposing; with 28 hydraulically actuated joints, LIDAR and stereo vision, a beefy on-board computer, and some of the most advanced robotic limbs ever conceived, Atlas is remarkably human-like in its behavior. While Atlas is initially conceived as a disaster response robot, such as cleaning up and looking for survivors after a Fukushima-like disaster, it’s easy to imagine Atlas being the basis of a robotic army, supported by BigDog mules.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/atlas-darpa-robot-high-res.jpg" width="2000" height="2754" /></p>\nAs you can see in the photo above and the video below, Atlas is incredibly technologically advanced. With 28 hydraulic joints, Atlas can replicate almost every degree of human motion — or, in the case of the robot hands provided by iRobot and Sandia National Labs, surpass them. Vision is provided by a Carnegie Robotics LIDAR and stereo camera system;LIDAR, or light-based radar, is the same detection and ranging system used by autonomous vehicles, such as Google’s self-driving car. LIDAR is expensive, but incredibly accurate. The tech specs say that Atlas has its own on-board hydraulic pump, but you can see in the video that it’s still tethered to some kind of off-board power/hydraulic supply. Like BigDog, whichstarted off tethered, Atlas will eventually be self-powered and free to roam wherever it wishes.\n\nAtlas has an on-board, real-time computer — but it hasn’t yet been loaded up with its software brain. As it stands, Atlas is a shell, and more than a dozen teams will now compete in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) to see who can create the best brain for Atlas. In December 2013, each team will load up an Atlas with its software and compete in a series of disaster response trials. The best teams will receive continued funding from DARPA, and will then compete in the DRC finals in December 2014. Whoever wins <em>that</em> will receive $2 million from DARPA, and presumably a big contract for the commercial production of Atlas robots.\n\nThe ostensible purpose of Atlas is disaster response. As you can see in the video, Atlas has no problem walking over rough terrain, and the robotic hands that it’s equipped with are some of most dexterous and flexible hands that money can buy. (Read more about the iRobot and Sandia robot hands.) Hopefully, Atlas will be able to wade into dangerous disaster zones and save human lives.\n\nIt is hard to ignore the fact that Atlas looks like a Terminator, though. Given that its canine predecessor, BigDog, will soon join the US Marines, it seems inevitable that Atlas will eventually find its way to the battlefield. When that happens, the US will be able to field robot soldiers that are stronger, more resilient, and probably more accurate with their weapons than their human counterparts. At first, as with today’s UAVs, Atlas soldiers will probably be operated by humans situated safely in a bunker back home — but as their software improves, autonomous robot soldiers are not out of the question.\n\nAnd then, a few months or years or decades later, they’ll take over the world.	t	t	t	0	0	0	DARPA and Boston Dynamics, of BigDog, Petman, and Cheetah fame, have unveiled their most advanced humanoid robot yet: Atlas.

Romotive engineers Phu Nguyen and Peter Seid invented a smartphone-powered Android – the <a href="http://romotive.com/meet-romo">Romo 3</a>. As soon as you dock your iDevice in its dedicated port, you can immediately train and utilize it as your digital pet or companion. For this entry, we’ll give you our full review of this innovative technology from Romotive.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Meet Romo 3</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The dock looks like a tiny bulldozer with a blue LED light on its body and a pair of rubberized threads on both sides. Using a dedicated <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/romo/id506577422">iOS application</a>, your handset’s screen will serve as its face. You’ll be greeted by a cute blue creature with two rounded eyes, a mouth, and teeth. It also displays different types of emotions: smile, wink, frown, and sad. It utilizes the front camera in order to recognize its master. After a series of training, it will start following you around your house and act as a digital pet. It can even run with with a blazing speed of up to 1.1 ft/s or 0.34 m/s on hardwood floors or tiles.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Device Compatibility</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The previous models (Romo 1 and 2) only support iDevices having a 30-pin connector such as the iPod Touch 4, iPhone 4, and 4s. In their third model, they plan to target new users of iPhones with 9-pin lightning connectors. The investors demonstrated an actual prototype which is fully compatible with the iPhone 5, 5c, 5s, and iPod Touch 5th generation.If you’re a little bit curious about the difference of the latest iDevice to its predecessors, go to the compare iPhone section of <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/iphone/iphone-5s">http://www.o2.co.uk/iphone/iphone-5s</a>.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How To Use</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A Wi-Fi or cellular data connection is required in order to remotely control and manipulate your digital toy through another iDevice. Setting up Romo for the very first time isn’t a difficult task. You are only required to create a user account upon launching the application. This profile will be used to link your other iDevices with the robot.</p>\n\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\n\t<li><em><strong>As a Telepresence Machine</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">To give it a more personal look, you can actually show yourself using the remote iDevice to replace the animated blue face. It’s even possible to control even if you're on the other side of the planet, so long as you have a reliable internet connection.</p>\n\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\n\t<li><em><strong>As a Digital Pet</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Interacting with this responsive machine is fun and entertaining. You can touch the screen to tickle Romo and see how he reacts. Using the front camera, the dock can also tilt and follow your movement in 15, 45,and 90 degrees angle to interact with you even if you are standing.</p>\n\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\n\t<li><em><strong>As a Remote-powered Toy</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Using another iDevice, you can view its real-time point-of-view and control the robot to tour you around your vicinity. You can also take remote pictures of the place using your gadget’s front and rear snapper. However, if you lose your internet connection, you can’t summon the machine back to your location.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Training</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You don’t have to be an expert to train the Android. It only uses your mobile camera to learn and understand you as its master. When you move a little bit closer to it, it will learn to move a little bit backwards. It’ll also mirror your facial emotion. There are also regular updates for its iOS application;adding new modules, language cards, and functionalities.The machine costs $149. Although it looks like just a toy, it’s actually suitable for all ages, especially those who are fond of robotics. What do you think of this iOS-powered robot?

By mimicking how these clams burrow through muddy soil in their coastal habitats, researchers developed a machine that could eventually aid in a variety of underwater tasks.\n\n"When we started the project, we were looking for a means of making small, lightweight, low-power systems to move through soil," said Amos Winter, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. "We figured there's probably an animal that has figured out how to do this well. Razor clams stuck out because they can move through more than a kilometer of soil with the energy of an AA battery."\n\n<object id="flashObj" width="400" height="292" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><param name="flashVars" value="videoId=3446557481001&amp;linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2F44689-burrowing-roboclam-inspired-by-nature-s-best-diggers-video.html&amp;playerID=1403109806001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAFR6xVM~,85KKOZyvPf6qwFANvqEzo9EFltY58YnJ&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true" /><param name="base" value="http://admin.brightcove.com" /><param name="seamlesstabbing" value="false" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="swLiveConnect" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1" /><param name="flashvars" value="videoId=3446557481001&amp;linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2F44689-burrowing-roboclam-inspired-by-nature-s-best-diggers-video.html&amp;playerID=1403109806001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAFR6xVM~,85KKOZyvPf6qwFANvqEzo9EFltY58YnJ&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="swliveconnect" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="pluginspage" value="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" /><embed id="flashObj" width="400" height="292" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1" flashVars="videoId=3446557481001&amp;linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2F44689-burrowing-roboclam-inspired-by-nature-s-best-diggers-video.html&amp;playerID=1403109806001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAFR6xVM~,85KKOZyvPf6qwFANvqEzo9EFltY58YnJ&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true" base="http://admin.brightcove.com" seamlesstabbing="false" allowFullScreen="true" swLiveConnect="true" allowScriptAccess="always" flashvars="videoId=3446557481001&amp;linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2F44689-burrowing-roboclam-inspired-by-nature-s-best-diggers-video.html&amp;playerID=1403109806001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAFR6xVM~,85KKOZyvPf6qwFANvqEzo9EFltY58YnJ&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true" allowfullscreen="true" swliveconnect="true" allowscriptaccess="always" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" /></object>\n<strong>Nature's best</strong>\n\nAtlantic razor clams dig by opening and closing their shells quickly, Winter explained. This rapid movement sucks in water, which creates a pocket of liquid, quicksand-like material around the clam's body. That watery mix reduces drag and helps the clam move downward through the wet sand.\n\n"The key motion is when the clam shuts its shell like a book. When this happens, it relieves the pressure from the shell pushing on the soil," Winter told Live Science. " As the clam shuts its shell, the liquidized region around the body makes it much easier to move through [that area] than the surrounding, static soil."\n\nWinter and his colleagues have been experimenting with a working prototype of the RoboClam. The researchers have performed more than 300 tests of the digging machine in their lab, and in the razor clam's natural environment in the mudflats off the coast of Gloucester, Mass.\n\nThe engineers found that the RoboClam can dig at about the same speed as real razor clams, which average about 0.4 inches (1 centimeter) per second.\n\nIn trials, the RoboClam has burrowed to a maximum depth of nearly 8 inches (20 cm). The real clams can dig to a depth of about 27.5 inches (70 cm), but the current robotic prototype is limited in its reach because its motors sit above the surface of the water, Winter said.\n\n<strong>Finding the sweet spot</strong>\n\nWinter said he was "pleasantly surprised" that the RoboClam could work as efficiently as the creatures that inspired it. The process of fine-tuning the machine involved figuring out the perfect speed at which to open and shut the "shells" of the robotic digger, he said. If the shells moved too quickly, the water and sand did not mix into the proper fluid consistency. If the shells moved too slowly, more sand collapses in around the body of the clam than it can handle, making it difficult to dig.\n\n"There's a sweet spot in between that maximum and minimum time," Winter said.\n\nThe researchers are still experimenting with the RoboClam, and have plans to build another prototype that could serve as a proof-of-concept model for a product that could become commercially available within two to five years, Winter said.\n\nThe researchers are already working closely with Bluefin Robotics, a Massachusetts-based company that builds and operates robotic underwater vehicles for defense, commercial and scientific purposes. The RoboClam could anchor Bluefin Robotics' vehicles when they need to remain stationary in a current, Winter said.\n\n"Other applications include general anchoring, even in boats," he added. "We could also use the RoboClam to lay underwater cable, blow up underwater mines or set sensors in the ocean."\n\nThe research was published online today (April 8) in the journal Bioinspiration &amp; Biomimetics.	t	t	t	0	0	0	A robot that can dig quickly and deeply into mud or wet sand could one day help lay underwater cables, dig up and detonate underwater mines, or anchor machines to the seafloor, researchers say.

They could be used on satellites to clean up some of the space junk in orbit, or on cars to reach out and break an impact.\n\n"Increasingly present in our daily lives and used to perform various tasks, robots will be able to either catch or dodge complex objects in full motion," Aude Billard, head of the team at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) that developed the arm, said in a statement.\n\nTo catch flying objects, a robot must react to unpredictable events and integrate several pieces of information in very little time, the researchers said. Many robots today have preprogrammed behavior, and make calculations that take too long for them to respond in a rapidly changing situation, such as to catch a moving object.\n\nTo achieve such rapid responses, researchers took inspiration from human learning methods of imitation, and trial and error. They used a technique called "programming by demonstration," in which the robot is not given specific instructions. Instead, researchers manually guided the arm to a catching position several times, until the robot learned to move into position itself.\n\nThe team tested the arm by throwing several different objects at it: a ball, an empty bottle, a half-full bottle, a hammer and a tennis racket. These objects have different centers of gravity, presenting unique challenges for the robot.\n\nDuring the first learning phase, the researchers threw objects at the robot several times. The robot used a series of cameras positioned around it to measure the trajectory, speed and rotation of the object in order to model its movement. It then performed a speedy calculation to move itself in the right direction, correcting its trajectory in real time and synchronizing its finger movements to catch the object.\n\nThe robotic arm is already being used as part of EPFL's Clean-mE project to develop technologies for recovering and disposing of space junk orbiting the Earth, researchers said.	t	t	t	0	0	0	There are some things a robot can't do, but catching a flying object is no longer one of them.

The device is particularly useful for robots, which have to navigate and locate themselves in the world. Indeed, a video showed how Google and its partners were putting the smartphone on different kinds of robots, including mobile platforms and manipulator arms.\n\nNow researchers at the University of Pennsylvania led by Professor Vijay Kumar are taking things one step further. After getting a Tango device from Google, they put it on one of their quadrotors and let it loose inside their lab.\n\nKumar says that a big challenge for researchers working with flying robots is not building them but rather developing hardware and software capable of making them autonomous. Many robots use GPS for guiding themselves, or, when flying indoors, they rely on motion tracking systems like Vicon and OptiTrack, which offer great accuracy but requires that you install sensors on walls and ceilings.\n\nA device capable of localizing itself in space without GPS or external sensors, as the Tango phone does, opens new possibilities for flying robots. Kumar says that the Google device is remarkable because it lets you "literally velcro it to a robot and have it be autonomous."\n\nGiuseppe Loianno, a PhD student in Kumar's group, has made a video showing their initial tests with the device. In the first part of the video, Loianno sets the quadrotor to hover at a fixed position and then perturbs it by moving it around, but the drone promptly returns to the starting point. Next Loianno commands the drone to go to different places in the room and, even if disturbed, the drone recovers and stays on its programmed path.\n<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/RE1YHlI1XHo" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>\nKumar says the only measurement from the Tango phone is its pose, which is the position plus orientation with reference to a starting coordinate system (captured at a rate of 30 Hz), and the only other sensor used is the IMU onboard the drone. (The laptop is not controlling flight autonomy in any way; it's only used to send a desired trajectory to the drone and to render a visualization of the its positions in space. And the quadrotor is a machine that Kumar's group designed and built with off-the-shelf components.)\n\nThe researchers now plan to study Tango's accuracy of localization (and compare it to external motion tracking systems), but from their initial tests they estimate the accuracy to be within a centimeter. If that proves to be the case (and if Tango can be made cheap enough), it will be an impressive capability for the Google device, which could revolutionize how mobile robots and drones navigate indoor spaces.\n\nKumar says that the convergence of computation, communication, and consumers has a huge potential for the robotics industry, and a device like Tango is a key advance because it's "lowering the barrier to entry for autonomous robots."	t	t	t	0	0	0	&nbsp; Early this year, Google unveiled its Project Tango smartphone, a mobile device equipped with a depth sensor, a motion tracking camera, and two vision processors that let the phone track its position in space and create 3D maps in real time.

In particular, several groups have focused on bio-inspired designs based on cheetahs.\n\nBut when a team at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) set out to create a new sprinting robot, they didn't look at big cats; instead, they found inspiration in a completely different kind of creature: a velociraptor.\n\nThe robot, called Raptor, has two nimble legs and a mechanism that mimics a tail. In a recent experiment, it achieved an impressive speed of 46 kilometers per hour on a treadmill.\n\nThat's faster than the fastest human, the Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt, whose top speed has been estimated at 43.92 km/h.\n\nAnd it's almost as fast as the world's fastest legged robot, Cheetah, built by Boston Dynamics, which reached 47 km/h in a trial two years ago, also on a treadmill.\n\nBut before you suggest a robot race between the two machines, note that both Raptor and Cheetah are attached to beams that keep them steady and prevent them from running off the treadmill—and crashing through a wall.\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/kaist-raptor-3-1401292992533.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1389" alt="kaist-raptor-3-1401292992533" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/kaist-raptor-3-1401292992533.png" width="620" height="354" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd despite their similar speeds, the two robots are very different. Cheetah is a hefty quadruped, powered by hydraulic actuators. Raptor is a compact, 3-kilogram machine, with two legs made of lightweight composite material.\n\nAnother difference is that Raptor has a tail. Although it looks nothing like a Velociraptor's tail, it works like one, moving rapidly to help the robot maintain its body stable while stepping over obstacles, says Jongwon Park, a PhD student at KAIST's Mechatronics, Systems, and Control Laboratory.\n\nPark developed Raptor along with colleagues Jinyi Lee, Jinwoo Lee, Kyung-Soo Kim, and Professor Soohyun Kim.\n\nA recent video of Raptor shows the robot progressively increasing its speed until it reaches the 46 km/h mark. The video also shows a researcher placing obstacles on the treadmill. Thanks to its tail, Raptor doesn't trip on them.\n\n&nbsp;\n<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/lPEg83vF_Tw" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUsing a tail for stability is not a new idea in robotics. MIT's cheetah-inspired quadruped has a mechanical tail, and a UC Berkeley wheeled robot features a tail that is also based on a velociraptor's.\n\nRaptor is not the first robot to sport legs with prosthetic blades, either. Another biped running robot, Athlete, built several years ago, also used carbon-fiber running blades.\n\nStill, Raptor stands out for its simplicity, showing that it's possible to achieve significant speeds with an uncomplicated design.\n\nUnlike other legged robots that rely on multiple actuators, Raptor uses just one motor per leg, which consists of a nine-bar linkage. To recover part of the energy used to make the robot move, the researchers added Achilles tendons that work as springs, absorbing and restoring energy with every step.\n\nThe robot's control system is also simple. Raptor runs a computer program known as a running pattern generator, which controls gait and speed.\n\nThe KAIST team is currently working to optimize their robot. They're interested not only in achieving ever-greater speeds, but also improving control and stability.\n\nWe've seen other legged robots take their first steps on treadmills and then learn to walk outside the lab. One example is HyQ, a quadruped from Italy. And then, of course, there's Boston Dynamics' WildCat (the successor to Cheetah), which was seen in a video bounding and galloping in a parking lot.\n\nWe hope the Korean researchers can build a version of Raptor that doesn't need a treadmill and that they can set free outdoors.\n\nAnd then we can have a robot race.	t	t	t	0	0	0	&nbsp; &nbsp; Researchers have long been interested in fast-running robots with powerful, agile legs.

In other words, they're not robotic limbs designed to replace biological limbs that you might be missing, but rather robotic limbs designed to augment the number of limbs that you have already.\n\nMIT researchers have been developing SRLs that can help you do stuff that would be annoying, uncomfortable, or impossible to do on your own. At the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in Hong Kong, they presented their latest SRL prototypes, with one model featuring a pair of limbs that spring from your shoulders and another with limbs that extend from your waist.\n\nMIT's shoulder-mounted SRL is designed to assist in tasks that take place over your head, or in situations where your other two arms are busy and you need a hand (literally) with something. One example, shown in the second video below, would be in a construction context, where anything that needs to be attached to a ceiling has to be held up and hammered or screwed into place at the same time.\n<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/klkGDKKRPYU" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LkXpldrhRm4" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n\nAnother example (that's probably a bit more common for most of us) is trying to open a door when you're holding something with both hands.\n\n<img alt="" src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/img/srl-img4-1401721722159.png" />\n\nThe SRL shoulder robot uses two arms mounted on your shoulders such that the reaction forces on them are aligned with the spine. Each arm has five degrees of freedom, with interchangeable and customizable end effectors, and the complete systems weighs about 4.5 kilograms (10 pounds).\n\nWhat's tricky about having a pair of shoulder arms is getting them to do what they're supposed to do without having to control them with your other arms, which would kind of defeat the purpose of the entire setup. Instead, the SRL watches what you're doing with your arms to decide how to move. It does that by monitoring two inertial measurement units (IMUs) that the user wears on the wrists. A third IMU sits at the base of the robot’s shoulder mount, to track the overall orientation and motion of the SRL.\n\nThe SRL uses the gyro and accelerometer data from the IMUs to make a prediction (based on a model that's been created by demonstration learning) about what would be the most helpful, proactive position for its own arms. If you put your arms up above your head, for example, the SRLs raise above your head too, because it figures you're trying to hold something up. Using their SRL prototype, the researchers are testing different "behavioral modes" to program the limbs to do what they want.\n\n"Once we combine the most significant behavioral modes we are able to control the robot such that, from the wearer's perspective, it behaves like an extension of his own body," says Baldin Llorens-Bonilla, a researcher at the d'Arbeloff Laboratory at MIT.\n\n<figure><img alt="" src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/img/srl-robot-arms-waist-1401717539211.png" /></figure>In addition to these extra shoulder arms, other researchers at the d'Arbeloff Lab, led by Professor Harry Asada, are constructing waist arms that can be used for holding objects as well as for bracing the user, much like an extra pair of legs [see concept, right].\n\nMuch of this research was sponsored by Boeing, which is interested in finding ways to keep its aging human workforce of aircraft builders from getting injured by repeatedly lifting heavy things, stooping, or crouching repeatedly over long periods of time. The waist-mounted SRLs can be used as two extra arms, two extra legs, or one of each, if that's what would work best. The example below shows SRLs being used to brace a worker as he drills a hole in an airframe:\n\n<img alt="" src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/img/srl-img2-1401720009265.png" />\n\nAnd the illustration below shows how SRLs can be positioned to support the bodyweight of the user:\n\n<img alt="" src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/img/srl-img3-1401720030411.png" />\n\nSo why not just go straight to a full-body exoskeleton instead of just additional arms? The researchers say that the constraint of an exoskeleton is that by definition it's bound to the body of the user: no matter what the most advantageous orientation for your limbs might be, the exoskeleton is putting all of its force wherever you decide to put your arms and legs. Having limbs that are powered yet completely separate gives the system many more option for helping you out.\n\nAnd of course, it's the best way to improve your ski-boxing.\n\n"A Robot on the Shoulder: Coordinated Human-Wearable Robot Control using Coloured Petri Nets and Partial Least Squares Predictions," by Baldin Llorens-Bonilla and H. Harry Asada from MIT, was presented at ICRA 2014 in Hong Kong.

There are never enough of them, they're never where you need them to be, and when you do plug into one, you end up with tangles of cords strewn all over the floor.\n\nNow Japanese researchers might have a solution, and it involves robots (of course). Their idea is to use autonomous mobile robots that deliver electricity to battery packs with outlets attached anywhere around the house, and they've built a proof-of-concept system to show how it would work.\n\n<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/hjdW3RAUrVA" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n\nThis is just an experiment at this point, and it is in no way optimized for electricity storage or delivery. The researchers, from the University of Tokyo and Keio University and led by Professor Takeo Igarashi, hacked a Roomba and some charging docks to work as their electricity-delivery system.\n\nInstead of vacuuming, the Roomba simply drives around looking for any charging docks. The researchers modified these docks by attaching a battery pack, an inverter, and other electronics to them [see schematics below]. When the Roomba attaches to a dock, it transfers energy from its own battery over to the dock's battery pack. And once the Roomba detects that its battery is depleted, it returns to a regular (unmodified) dock to recharge.\n\n<figure><img alt="" src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/img/robot_batt-1402071189032.jpg" />\n<figcaption>Image: IGARASHI Design Interface Project</figcaption></figure>As the system gets refined, it might benefit from (say) something like a supercapacitor that could transfer electricity faster, or a dedicated mobile platform. Or on the other hand, sticking with the Roomba means that you could have a robot keeping your house clean <em>and</em> keeping your stuff charged.\n\nThe researchers experimented with a variety of different charging strategies, which the user can select for each appliance (or each dock location) through Wi-Fi and an app.\n\nThere's the "greedy" strategy, where the robot delivers as much power as it can whenever it can, which works best for sporadically used, high-drain devices. The "optimistic" strategy delivers power to appliances when they're running low, which works for low-power devices that remain operating for long periods, like fans or floor lamps.\n\nAnd the robot can also deliver power on a schedule that you set, which is ideal for electronics that you only use at certain times during the day (say, a music player), or if you want to make sure that the robot isn't roaming around under your feet when you're at home.\n\nIt's easy to imagine how this concept could be more tightly integrated into a home environment. Perhaps something like a coffee table could include a robot dock and battery, with available outlets for you to plug your gadgets into to charge them.\n\nAnd if you add a short-range wireless charging system, this coffee table would charge your devices whenever you set anything down, with no wires anywhere to be seen.\n\n"Delivering Electricity to Home Appliances by Mobile Robots," by Kentaro Ishii, Youichi Kamiyama, Wirawit Chaochaisit, Masahiko Inami, and Takeo Igarashi, from the University of Tokyo and Keio University, was presented this week at ICRA 2014 in Hong Kong.

And it has an “emotion engine,” designed to understand how people are feeling and react accordingly.\n\nAldebaran built the robot for SoftBank, the Japanese telecom giant, which plans to start selling it to consumers in Japan next February for 198,000 yen, or about US $1,900. The robot will be produced by Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which makes iPhones and other Apple products.\n<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/osD6O4LAcpo" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n\nPepper won’t help you cook dinner or clean the house. It’s conceived as a communication and companion robot. And apparently it loves to tell jokes.\n\n“Pepper, please explain some of your functions,” said SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son as he introduced the robot at an event in Tokyo.\n\n“Masa, I don't want to show off,” Pepper replied, “this might take over 100 hours.”\n\nIn the demonstration, the robot moved its body so smoothly that one observer later said it was as if there were a small person inside of it. But Pepper’s actions seemed to have been carefully pre-programmed, so it still remains to be seen how it will behave in real environments.\n\nSon said a lot of effort went into developing the robot's software. The main goal was making Pepper able to recognize people’s emotions by analyzing their speech, facial expressions, and body language, and then deliver appropriate responses. If you look sad, say, Pepper will try to cheer you up by playing one of your favorite songs.\n\nAs Son put it, their goal was “giving the robot a heart.”\n\nStarting tomorrow, people can meet Pepper at two SoftBank stores in Tokyo, and more will follow, he said.\n\n<figure><img alt="" src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/img/pepper-img-1-1401990307112.png" />\n<figcaption>Photo: SoftBank/Aldebaran Robotics</figcaption> <figcaption>Bruno Maisonnier from Aldebaran and Masayoshi Son from SoftBank with Pepper in Tokyo.</figcaption></figure>Pepper’s creators know they can’t program the robot to behave perfectly in all situations, so they wanted the robot to learn on its own. According to Son, the robots deployed at SoftBank stores will start collecting data on their interactions with people. When Pepper tells a joke, it will observe if people laugh, for example.\n\nThe robots will upload their data to a cloud-based repository. This “cloud AI,” as Son called it, will use the combined data to improve Pepper’s behavior. “The robot is going to evolve through this collective wisdom,” he said.\n\nThe data collection will continue when Pepper is used in homes. In one example described in the presentation, if the robot reads a book that many kids like, it may suggest that same book to more kids. But Son was careful to emphasize that the cloud system will not collect private information.\n\nAs Pepper’s technology improves, SoftBank envisions the robot entertaining people at parties, playing with children, and keeping company to the elderly.\n<h4>SOUL OF A NEW MACHINE</h4>\nBruno Maisonnier, founder and CEO of Aldebaran, said that his company worked for more than two years on the project. The result is an impressive feat of engineering.\n\nThe robot is 1.2 meter tall and weighs 28 kilograms, and it carries a 10.1-inch touch screen on its chest. It has 20 motors and can move its head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, fingers, hips, and knees. Aldebaran developed a proprietary mechanism to measure electrical current consumption on each motor, allowing the robot to detect forces on its body. In addition, Hall effect sensors are used for motor positioning.\n\nThe robot’s head has four microphones, two HD cameras (in the mouth and forehead), and a 3-D depth sensor (behind the eyes). There’s a gyroscope in the torso and touch sensors in the head and hands. The mobile base has two sonars, six lasers, three bumper sensors, and a gyro, and it can drive at up to 3 kilometers per hour [see full specs below].\n\nThe robot spoke only in Japanese at the demo, but it can also speak English, French, and Spanish.\n\nPepper’s battery operates for up to 12 hours, though in the future that may change if Aldebaran equips the robot with legs, a possibility that Son mentioned at the event. Aldebaran has been working on a bipedal robot called Romeo that's of a similar stature, so a walking model may not be too far off.\n\n<img alt="" src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/img/pepper-specs-1401990154313.png" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe success of Aldebaran's first robot, NAO, seems to have helped guide the design of the new humanoid. There are more than 5,000 NAOs in 70 countries, used in research, education, and to help sick kids.\n\nMaisonnier said Pepper is different from Nao in size and appearance, but the two robots share many similarities. The two rely on the same software foundation, called NAOqi, which tries to make robot programming easier. Applications developed for NAO are expected to be compatible with Pepper, and vice versa.\n\nAldebaran plans to open up Pepper to developers (through an API), who’ll be able to create applications that they can offer to other users, much like our smartphone apps, continually expanding the robot’s capabilities.\n\nThis robots app strategy is similar to that adopted by other robots such as NEC's PaPeRo and Fujisoft's Palro, which also try to benefit from the rapid adoption of mobile applications.\n\nAldebaran is planning a developers conference in September to explain in detail the robot and the SDK it will release. “The goal is to have a community of people who want to develop applications to help the robot grow,” Maisonnier said. And he wants not only programmers to participate, but also artists, musicians, and graphic designers.\n<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/mCKyI4e3n_4" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>	t	t	t	0	0	0	&nbsp; French robotics company Aldebaran unveiled its newest robot, a friendly humanoid named Pepper that seems determined to make everyone smile.

158	Big and Little Legged Robots Team Up to Conquer Terrain	big-and-little-legged-robots-team-up-to-conquer-terrain	2	\N	\N	2014-06-19 10:16:37+05:30	2015-06-24 12:47:32.12473+05:30	<img alt="" src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/img/starleth-1402484090211.jpg" />\n\nHumans, robots, and anything else with legs can have issues with navigating terrain that's rough, sticky, or slippery. Navigating dangerous terrain like this isn't necessarily a problem, as long as there's a little bit of advanced warning. Imagine the difference between walking out onto an icy sidewalk that you <em>are </em>expecting, as opposed to walking out onto an icy sidewalk that you're <em>not </em>expecting.\n\nThe tricky thing is that "expecting" bit: short of actually stepping on a surface, how do you know what to expect? A robot can try relying on sensors to identify and avoid slippery terrain, but researchers from UC Berkeley and ETH Zurich came up with another effective strategy, which they presented last week at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).\n\nThe strategy consists in using teams of robots and sending some of them ahead of the others, to see if they slip and fall. This approach can get expensive, unless you use a heterogeneous team: one big expensive robot that you care about, with a bunch of little cheap robots that you don't, acting as a picket line of terrain scouts. Here's a video demonstrating the concept:\n<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/9bxVaafV7q4" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou might recognize both of the robots in this video: the big one is ETH Zurich's StarlETH quadruped, while the little one is VelociRoACH, from UC Berkeley. VelociRoACH's job is to scurry around ahead of StarlETH, exploring the terrain. StarlETH watches the optical tag on VelociRoACH's back to see how the little robot is doing, and VelociRoACH also sends back IMU data.\n\nTogether, the robots are able to classify terrain as either slippery or safe to walk on with an accuracy of over 90 percent, and since StarlETH is able to localize VelociRoACH as it scampers around, StarlETH knows exactly where it is (or isn't) safe to step.\n\nThe risk here is that your poor little scout robot might end up stumbling onto a piece of terrain that's so dangerous that it gets stuck. This is better than your<em>primary robot</em> getting stuck (and the scout robot is still accomplishing what it was intended to accomplish by warning the primary robot of the danger), but you need to be prepared to consider these scout robots as expendable, which is why VelociRoACH is the robot of choice, as it's made mostly of cardboard, and you can just toss a bunch more into the mix to replace any robots that you may lose.\n\nWhile the video above shows a demo with just one scout robot, using multiple robots would be even more effective. And since they're cheap, there's no reason not to use lots of them. Future work will experiment with formations of picket robots to more effectively map larger areas of potentially hazardous terrain.\n\nOh, and the most potentially hazardous terrain of all? Right underneath the foot of StarlETH, at least as far as VelociRoACH is concerned.\n<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/w_K62RxZ-qQ" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLuckily, VelociRoACH isn't just cheap, it's also durable, as lead author Duncan Haldane told us: "After VelociRoACH got stepped on, we just pulled it out and kept running it. No problems."\n\n"Detection of Slippery Terrain with a Heterogeneous Team of Legged Robots," by Duncan W. Haldane, Peter Fankhauser, Roland Siegwart, and Ronald S. Fearing, from UC Berkeley and ETH Zurich, was presented at ICRA 2014 in Hong Kong.	t	t	t	0	0	0	Humans, robots, and anything else with legs can have issues with navigating terrain that's rough, sticky, or slippery.

It's really bad. For a drone that can hover and carry any sort of payload, you're looking at 10, maybe 20 minutes tops. And even fixed-wing drones don't do all that much better. This is such an issue that CyPhy Works has developed drones that are continuously supplied with power through a tether, and there are other, slightly crazier (or less immediately practical, let's say) ideas about how to provide drones with power on the fly, like lasers or midair wireless power transfer.\n\nOne less crazy idea is to just have drones perch: that is, to spend as much time as possible <em>not</em> flying by finding somewhere near where they need to be that they can land and sit. And wouldn't it be great if drones could recharge themselves by perching on powerlines and harnessing the magnetic fields that they emit?\n\nMIT has been working on drones that can perch on powerlines for a few years now. Perching isn't so hard for an aircraft that can hover: we've seen quadrotors do it already. But for fixed-wing drones, perching becomes much more complicated, since the drone needs to go from forward flight to something very close to zero velocity in a very small window of space and time.\n\nIt's a difficult problem, but certainly not impossible, because we see birds do it over and over again every day, by executing a stall maneuver right before they reach the location that they want to perch on. When talking about aircraft, a stall simply means that the angle of attack of a wing gets high enough, coupled with an airspeed that's low enough, that the air moving over the top of wing separates from the wing itself. This results in an abrupt decrease in lift and increase in drag, and usually, it's a very bad thing, unless you can pull it off on purpose at exactly the right moment, like just in front of a powerline, as a glider from MIT can do:\n<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/V35ylAAPVMM" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n\nIn these experiments, the location of the line is known to the system, but the glider itself  has on-board sensors and electronics that can plan and execute the perching maneuver in real-time. The sensors are not especially complex, and the actuation on the aircraft is minimal: none of the complex wing morphology that birds have is necessary to make the perching maneuver work. What's also notable is that the perching is successful (95 percent of the time) even in variable starting conditions, as you'd get when you've got a human doing the launching. This is important, because outside of the lab, the aircraft is going to have to deal with a lot of additional uncertainties, like wind.\n\nWhile it's tempting to focus on the powerline harvesting aspect of this research (like, um, we did), the researchers are emphasizing that what they've really shown is the simplicity of the perching maneuver itself. In other words, a lot of what birds have going on with their complex wings and feathers and build-in neural control system may not be necessary for a maneuver that seems, at first glance, like it should be quite difficult. This means that potentially, all kinds of UAVs, no matter what their level of complexity, might be able to substantially improve their capabilities and versatility by adding perching to their repertoire of tricks.	t	t	t	0	0	0	The biggest thing holding drones back right now (especially small, inexpensive drones) is arguably battery life.

But for the rest (indeed for most people), programming is not necessarily a skill that they have at their fingertips. And even if you're comfortable with writing code in general, writing code that gets a very complicated and expensive robot to do exactly what you want it to do is (to put it mildly) not easy.\n\nThe way robots are <em>supposed</em> to work (if we believe every science fictions show ever, which we do) is that they can listen to you yell at them, understand what you're on about, and then follow the instructions that they've been given just as well as a human can. "As well as a human can" means understanding abstract concepts and making inferences when necessary, which is something that robots, as a rule, are absolutely terrible at.\n\nRobots like to have detailed instructions about everything: if you want a scoop of ice cream, they need to know what ice cream is, where it is, how to open it, what to scoop it out with, how to grip the scoop, how to perform the scooping action, how to verify that the scoop was successful, how to get the ice cream from the scoop into a—oh wait, we forgot about the bowl, the robot has to have all the bowl stuff figured out in advance.\n\nAnd there's the problem: "get me a scoop of ice cream" is actually an <em>incredibly</em> complicated chain of actions that need to be executed in just the right way, and no human has the patience to spell it all out like a robot would want.\n\nCornell is trying to fix this problem by teaching robots to interpret natural language instructions, even casual ones, so that a PR2 can bring you some fancy ice cream.\n<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/73ofcHex92E" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n\nMost robots would panic given instructions that vague, but the special sauce that Ashutosh Saxena's Robot Learning Lab has developed enables the PR2 to make logical inferences about missing steps or poor instructions. From the press release:\n<blockquote><em>Saxena's robot, equipped with a 3-D camera, scans its environment and identifies the objects in it, using computer vision software previously developed in Saxena's lab. The robot has been trained to associate objects with their capabilities: A pan can be poured into or poured from; stoves can have other objects set on them, and can heat things. So the robot can identify the pan, locate the water faucet and stove and incorporate that information into its procedure. If you tell it to "heat water" it can use the stove or the microwave, depending on which is available. And it can carry out the same actions tomorrow if you've moved the pan, or even moved the robot to a different kitchen.</em>\n\n<em>Other workers have attacked these problems by giving a robot a set of templates for common actions and chewing up sentences one word at a time. Saxena's research group uses techniques computer scientists call "machine learning" to train the robot's computer brain to associate entire commands with flexibly defined actions. The computer is fed animated video simulations of the action –- created by humans in a process similar to playing a video game – accompanied by recorded voice commands from several different speakers.</em>\n\n<em>The computer stores the combination of many similar commands as a flexible pattern that can match many variations, so when it hears "Take the pot to the stove," "Carry the pot to the stove," "Put the pot on the stove," "Go to the stove and heat the pot" and so on, it calculates the probability of a match with what it has heard before, and if the probability is high enough, it declares a match. A similarly fuzzy version of the video simulation supplies a plan for the action: Wherever the sink and the stove are, the path can be matched to the recorded action of carrying the pot of water from one to the other.</em></blockquote>\nWith variations in the environment and command structure, the PR2 was able to make ice cream and ramen that didn't suck about 64 percent of the time, which is " three to four times better than previous methods." So, not bad, and it'll improve as the robot gains more experience, which one can help it do through a crowdsourced simulation game.\n\nCapabilities like this are absolutely necessary for home robots that are usable by people who have no idea how to use a robot, but there's another layer here that's arguably just as complicated. The robot can understand relatively abstract (in a programming sense) commands like "add ice cream to a bowl," but even if the robot knows to go find a bowl and some ice cream, it also needs to know what a "bowl" and "ice cream" are in the first place (as well as what "add" means in terms of size). This is especially tricky if the robot is entering an environment where it's never been before, or if you buy some crazy gourmet ice cream that doesn't come in a gallon-sized bucket.\n\nSolving these problems isn't the point of this research, of course, but it's worth considering the steps that are necessary for end-to-end user-friendly in-home ice cream service by a $400,000 robot. And there are many ways in which these problems <em>can</em> be solved: using natural spoken language interfaces for the initial training of a robot is one option, where you'd show it a bowl and say, "hey robot, this is a bowl for ice cream, got it?" Another option is to use the cloud to access a database of bowls, and/or semantic mapping to perform a search for bowl-like objects.\n\nWhat's exciting about this is how you can see research building towards a point where robots that fundamentally understand humans, and can act on that understanding, will be ready to come into our homes and reliably do stuff that's actually useful without requiring supervision, micromanagement, tech support, or therapy.	t	t	t	0	0	0	It's possible, even probable, that if you're reading this article, you either know how to program a robot or could figure it out if you really put your mind to it.

The all-terrain vehicle developed by Oshkosh Defense resembles an ordinary military vehicle equipped with a mine roller that can clear the way ahead of convoys without a human driver.\n\nOshkosh Defense has worked with both the U.S. Marines and Army to figure out how its TerraMax Unmanned Ground Vehicle could act as the vanguard or scout for manned military vehicles—using mine rollers and ground penetrating radar to detect and set off mines or improvised explosive devices(IEDs). In a worst-case scenario, the TerraMax minesweeper could take the brunt of roadside bomb explosions or ambushes and spare the human soldiers following behind in their own vehicles. Oshkosh recently showed off its vehicle's capability to navigate courses simulating minesweeping missions at the Eurosatory 2014 defense exhibition held in Paris from June 16-20.\n\n"In today's conflicts, the frontlines have been blurred and troops carrying out logistics missions are exposed to improvised explosive devices and other lethal threats previously reserved for battle zones," said John Urias, president of Oshkosh Defense and a retired U.S. Army Major General, in a press release. "The Oshkosh TerraMax UGV has the potential to reduce troops’ exposure to these threats, while optimizing the number of troops needed for such operations."\n\nOshkosh Defense has refined the TerraMax's self-driving capabilities since the vehicle participated in the U.S. military's DARPA Urban Challenge in 2007, an urban race for robotic vehicles. The brains of the TerraMax UGV—a module containing both software and multiple sensors—could also work with other vehicles. Such technology could theoretically make any military vehicle into a robot capable of working tirelessly through darkness, dust, rain, and snow.\n\nThe company also envisions its TerraMax robotic vehicles playing many different roles for the U.S. military in supply convoys, airfield construction, and similar operations. But the company is not alone in its race to sell robotic vehicles to the U.S. military. Defense giant Lockheed Martin has also demonstrated a similar autonomous system that can transform military supply trucks into self-driving vehicles.\n\nIn the long run, the U.S. military could eventually have supply convoys consisting almost entirely of robotic vehicles such as minesweepers and supply trucks. That not only takes humans out of potential harm's way, but it could also help the U.S. Army fulfill its vision of reducing the number of troops relegated to the logistics tail of military operations.	t	t	t	0	0	0	A robotic minesweeper aims to defuse lethal roadside bombs that represented the signature weapon killed or wounded thousands of troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.

163	How Squishy Would You Like Your Robot?	how-squishy-would-you-like-your-robot	2	\N	\N	2014-08-11 20:03:53+05:30	2015-06-24 12:47:38.98723+05:30	<img alt="" src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/img/squishy-1405415314272.jpg" />\n\nMost robots are rigid. Rigid is easy to design, easy to construct, easy to calibrate, and more reliable for all of those dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks that robots excel at. When robots make fundamental structural compromises to rigidity, they do it in complicated ways, like with series elastic actuators or hydraulics. It's worth it, though, because adding squishiness can make robots both more capable and safer to be around through passive compliance.\n\nTaking this concept to the extreme has resulted in some incredibly squishy robots, including soft robots that can walk, and other soft robots that can roll. But in both of these cases, embracing squishy properties means giving up rigidity. MIT has been working on a structure for a robot that offers both: squishy when you want it, and rigidity when you don't.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/aozu2C9Kmlg" height="349" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>\nThe MIT approach involves taking a material or structure that's inherently soft and modifying it with another material that can phase change between hard and soft states. In this case, MIT is using a scaffold made of foam that's been coated with wax. Wax, being wax, transitions between solid and liquid at a relatively low temperature. When the wax is cold and solid, the foam structure is rigid, but if the wax is heated to soften it, the entire foam structure becomes soft as well.\n\nThe researchers also demonstrated that by selectively deforming parts of a structure, they could create joints and make the structure move using a cable (as seen in the video). We're guessing that as a next step several of these deformable structures could be combined to create a robot that can crawl and squeeze into tight spaces.\n\nAnd wax is one of the easier and safer materials to use for this purpose, although there are many other options, like liquid metals or magnetorheological or electrorheological fluids, which respond to magnetic and electrical fields.\n\nThe project began as a collaboration with Boston Dynamics, as part of DARPA's ChemBot program (which led to some really cool and weird soft robots, like this and this). The MIT researchers, led by Anette Hosoi, a professor of mechanical engineering and applied mathematics, have since teamed up with the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization and Stony Brook University to continue developing versatile, deformable robots.\n\nThe researchers say that robots like these would be ideal for search and rescue scenarios, where you'd need a lot of compliance and flexibility for crawling around and through jumbled piles of rubble. They also suggest that robots like these would be great for crawling around inside your body, where they'd be able to "reach a particular point without damaging any of the organs or vessels along the way."

Despite rains outside, students turned up in a respectable number to learn the basics of robotics. The main speakers for the session were Ruchita Kachhap and Harsheel Soin (3<sup>rd</sup> Year UG students) with ocassional inputs from Soumyadeep Mukherjee (4<sup>th</sup> Year UG Student).\n\nThe session began at about 6:45pm with the speakers asking for feedback regarding the previous session (KRAIG 101) and looking to clarify any doubts that might have crept in students' minds. Then began a recapitulation of the fundamentals of the previous session. The basic topic of the class was the building and controlling of a differential drive based robot.\n\nFor those who couldn't attend due to some reasons, or simply for the curious, here's a brief overview of what was taught in the class:\n\n<b>MOTOR DIRECTION CONTROL</b>\n\nA Basic DC motor has two terminals. It can rotate both in clockwise and anticlockwise directions, depending on the direction of potential difference between the two terminals. If both terminals are at equal potential, the motor doesn't move and it becomes quite difficult to move it manually too. This condition is known as breaking condition\n\nWhen circuit is not completed between the two terminals of the motor, the motor does not oppose the motion of the shaft. So the shaft moves freely and can be turned using a hand, and this condition is called free run condition.\n\nTruth Table for a 12V DC Motor :\n<table width="643" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign="top" width="214">\n<p align="center"><b>Potential at T1 wrt ground</b></p>\n</td>\n<td valign="top" width="214">\n<p align="center"><b>Potential at T2 wrt ground</b></p>\n</td>\n<td valign="top" width="214">\n<p align="center"><b>Direction of Rotation</b></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign="top" width="214">\n<p align="center">12V</p>\n</td>\n<td valign="top" width="214">\n<p align="center">0V</p>\n</td>\n<td valign="top" width="214">\n<p align="center">(If) Clockwise</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign="top" width="214">\n<p align="center">0V</p>\n</td>\n<td valign="top" width="214">\n<p align="center">12V</p>\n</td>\n<td valign="top" width="214">\n<p align="center">(Then) Anticlockwise</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign="top" width="214">\n<p align="center">12V</p>\n</td>\n<td valign="top" width="214">\n<p align="center">12V</p>\n</td>\n<td valign="top" width="214">\n<p align="center">Breaking Condition</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign="top" width="214">\n<p align="center">0V</p>\n</td>\n<td valign="top" width="214">\n<p align="center">0V</p>\n</td>\n<td valign="top" width="214">\n<p align="center">Breaking Condition</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<b>SWITCHES</b>\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>DPDT:</b> DPDT stands for Double Pole Double Throw switch. It makes or breaks two connections at the same time, in two different directions. That is, it has six terminals in total, with the middle two terminals being able to connect to either the two upper terminals or two lower terminals at a time, but not both</li>\n\t<li><b>Relay:</b> A relay is a five terminal device that works on the principle of electromagnetism. When given some potential difference across the two terminals of the electromagnet, the connection is made in one direction (NO) and broken in another (NC). It works as a single pole, double throw switch, but doesn't require manual tapping.\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Untitled.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1426" alt="Untitled" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Untitled.png" width="512" height="302" /></a></li>\n\t<li><b>SPST: </b>An SPST which stands for single pole single throw is what a regular light switch is. It completes or breaks one connection at a time, that too only in a single direction. They are also known as push button switches.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>DIFFERENTIAL DRIVE MECHANICS</b>\n\nA Differential drive consists of two motorized wheels that can spin in same or opposite directions, or can entirely be stopped. Thus forward backward movements along with turns can be achieved, and also it can be used perform a 360 degree turn while keeping static at the original position.\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Untitled1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1427" alt="Untitled" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Untitled1.png" width="557" height="302" /></a>\n\n<b>DIODES</b>\n\nDiodes are semiconductor devices with very low resistance for flow of current in one direction and very high for flow of current in another, so it allows unidirectional flow of current only.  Ideally resistance is zero for one direction and infinite for the other.\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Untitled2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1428" alt="Untitled" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Untitled2.png" width="598" height="402" /></a>\n\n<b>CONTROL BOX FOR THE ROBOT</b>\n\nThe demonstrated control box consisted of 2 relays, two push button switches, power source along with the motor that needed to be controlled using the box. The robot controls were similar to the WSAD configuration used for playing PC games (W-forward, S-Backward, A-Strafe Left, D-Strafe Right). The speakers also drew the circuit line by line and explained everything clearly. The circuit diagram of the box was as follows:\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Untitled3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1429" alt="Untitled" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Untitled3.png" width="464" height="278" /></a>\n\nThe final circuit that was to be used for controlling the robot for the robosoccer event was also shown. It looked like:\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Untitled4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1430" alt="Untitled" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Untitled4.png" width="264" height="351" /></a>\n\nThis pretty much summed up the meeting. In the end, some of the inquisitive learners tried to clarify their doubts and members of TRS were happy doing that. The session ended at about 8:00PM and the audience departed, elated and fascinated.\n\nAuthor: Siddharth Jha\n\n&nbsp;	t	t	t	0	0	0	The second iteration of the KRAIG (Kharagpur Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Group) robotics introductory sessions, christened KRAIG 102 was organized by the Technology Robotix Society (TRS) yesterday in the evening in V1 seminar hall at 6:30 PM.

The classes also dealt with the important concept of rectifiers.</span>\n\nKraig 103 started off where Kraig 102 had left i.e. control box circuit. The doubts that many students had pertaining to the above stated topic were cleared. It was followed by the division of class into 6 parts wherever there was a working power socket so that the soldering irons could be plugged.\n\nP.C.B. Soldering is a process which involves making a blob of solder on each of the dot of the P.C.B. and then joining the blobs together to form a straight continuous line. The correct method of doing so is to hold the tip of the soldering iron at 45° angle from the P.C.B. and then bring the solder wire into contact so that it melts and falls on the desired place. After repeating this for desired number of dots they are connected by melting some solder wire between two consecutive blobs and connecting them. This works as the solder being an alloy of tin and lead has comparatively low melting point. It was also prescribed that some solder wire should first be melted on the tip of a new soldering iron to ensure that the solder then sticks to the different metal on the P.C.B. After explaining this all present students got a chance to practice soldering and they were asked to try and solder two lines on the P.C.B. as near as possible. This concluded Kraig 103.\n\nKraig 104 started off with teaching about rectifiers which are an effective replacement of adapters. They convert A.C. voltage into regulated D.C voltage. A rectifier uses the polar property of a diode i.e. a diode allows only unidirectional current to pass through it which happens when the P- terminal is at higher voltage then the N- terminal of the diode. This configuration is known as forward bias of the diode. The following shows a basic circuit for the rectifier circuit.\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kraig103.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1435" alt="Kraig103" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kraig103.png" width="562" height="240" /></a>\n\nThe diodes at the right top and left bottom are in forward bias in the positive half cycle and the diodes at the left top and the bottom right are in forward bias in the negative half cycle of the voltage. Hence current always flows in one direction in the circuit. The first capacitor is known as filter which converts the varying signals (as shown below) to ripple voltage.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kraig1031.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1436" alt="Kraig103" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kraig1031.png" width="376" height="248" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kraig1032.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1437" alt="Kraig103" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kraig1032.png" width="504" height="235" /></a>\n\nFig 1 shows voltage after only rectifier and fig 2 shows voltage after filtering the voltage using a capacitor. The filtering works on the property of capacitor to store charge when voltage across terminals is increasing and give it away when the reverse happens i.e. the voltage across its terminals decreases.\n\nThis is followed by a 78xx I.C. which is voltage regulator, where xx denotes its output voltage. It removes the ripples from the voltage and the voltage looks like:\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kraig1033.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1438" alt="Kraig103" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kraig1033.png" width="403" height="279" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHence we arrive at a regulated voltage as we wished to. The capacitor after this I.C. is used to take away whatever little ripples are left.\n\nWith this,  the topic of the rectifier circuit was concluded.\n\nAfter this the class was asked to do soldering practice in case somebody had not done so previously.\n\nThis concluded the Kraig 104 session. The audience left the hall fascinated and all the inquisitive students had their thirst of knowledge fulfilled!	t	t	t	0	0	0	Author : Vraj Parikh Kraig 103 and Kraig 104 were mainly hands on sessions for the skills required to make a robosoccer robot i.e. soldering and control box.

Otherwise, the following tutorials can be referred:\n1. <a href="http://www.robotix.in/tutorials/category/kraig/dd">Differential Drive</a>\n2. <a href="http://www.robotix.in/tutorials/category/avr/avrbasics">AVR / Arduino</a>\n3. <a href="http://www.robotix.in/tutorials/categ/avr/adc">ADC</a>\n\n<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">What the robot requires to do?</span>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Traverse arena using hand gestures.</li>\n\t<li>Pick and drop victims.</li>\n\t<li>Identify metal mines on the arena.</li>\n</ul>\nTechnically what the bot has to do:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Control the rotation of motors using hand gestures.</li>\n\t<li>Controlling the gripper using gesture.</li>\n\t<li>Implement metal detection.</li>\n</ul>\nNow let us analyse how each of these can be achieved.\n\nGesture control:\nThere are many ways by which we can implement gesture control. For that we require a sensor or a device that could differentiate different orientations of our hands with respect to a reference position.\nwe can achieve this by using following sensors and devices.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Accelerometers</li>\n\t<li>Gyroscopic sensors/inertial measurement units</li>\n\t<li>Using camera and image processing.</li>\n</ul>\nLet’s have a look at how the methods mentioned above can be employed to achieve our objective - gesture recognition.\n\nWe can use a camera that will capture the image of our hand and process the image in order to recognize what orientation it is in and can instruct the bot to move accordingly. But this requires too much of coding and processing power. If you are interested you can go through the image processing tutorials on our website.\n\nAnother easier way to achieve gesture control is using sensors like accelerometer or gyroscope sensor. These sensors can be placed on our hand and as we change the orientation of our hand the orientation of the sensors is also changed with respect to a particular reference orientation.\nAccelerometer or gyroscope sensor?\n\nBoth of the above mentioned sensors can be used effectively to achieve what we want, but we would suggest using an accelerometer as is it a lot less expensive than gyroscopic sensors or inertial measurement units and works well, with good resolution.\n\nMoreover gyroscopic sensors calculate angular velocity instead of acceleration so we will have to integrate it in order to get acceleration which can induce more error in the readings.\n\nGesture control using accelerometer:\n\nUsing gesture control we need to accomplish two things:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Locomotion/traversal</li>\n\t<li>Clasping victims/objects</li>\n</ul>\nIn order to understand how an accelerometer works and get an insight into how it can be used to fulfill our purpose, you might want to first go through the <a href="http://www.robotix.in/tutorials/categ/auto/accelero">accelerometer tutorial</a> on our website and read it thoroughly.\n\nLocomotion/traversal:\n\nAfter reading the accelerometer tutorial, you will get an idea about how an accelerometer works, and can then work on the following set of instructions:\n\nLet the accelerometer be placed on the top of the palm with the palm parallel to the ground. Consider the x axis output values of the accelerometer. Here X axis is along your hand as indicated by the horizontal dashed line in the following images.\nThe ADC values of x-out pin in accelerometer will vary from one extreme to another extreme corresponding to the following two extreme positions of the palm (i.e. forward tilt and backward tilt) and would lie somewhere in between the two when the palm is parallel to the ground.\n-Say the ADC values from the output pin “x-out” vary from 100 to 450 between the extremes and is around 250 in the middle.\n\n<img alt="" src="http://www.robotix.in/Images/Tuts/Minefield/image02.jpg" />\nFig 1 : One extreme(adc value is minimum, say 100)\n\n<img alt="" src="http://www.robotix.in/Images/Tuts/Minefield/image03.jpg" />\n\nFig 2 : Other extreme(adc value is maximum, say 450)\n\nSimilarly,  along the y-axis let the values of the “y-out” pin vary from 100 to 450 during left extreme tilt to right extreme tilt respectively. The y-axis is as shown in the figure, perpendicular to the x-axis, in the plane parallel to the ground.\n\n<img alt="" src="http://www.robotix.in/Images/Tuts/Minefield/image01.jpg" />\n\nFig 3: One extreme(“y-out” adc value is minimum, say 100)\n\n<img alt="" src="http://www.robotix.in/Images/Tuts/Minefield/image05.jpg" />\n\nFig 4: One extreme(“y-out” adc value is maximum, say 450)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlgorithm for controlling the motors:\nNow that we have different ranges of ADC values for each gesture, we can run our Differential drive according to it depending on which range the ADC values of the 3 output pins is lying.\n\nPseudo Code:\n\n<em>//Comment this code or replace the numeric values with X-min (value of X-axis when hand bent down), X-max (value of X-axis when hand bent up), X-mid (Middle range)</em>\n\n<em>if(x-out&lt;125 &amp;&amp; y-out &gt;125 &amp;&amp; y-out&lt;425) //\nmove forward;</em>\n\n<em>else if(x-out&gt;425 &amp;&amp; y-out &gt;125 &amp;&amp; y-out&lt;425) //\nmove back ;</em>\n\n<em>else if(x-out&gt;125 &amp;&amp; x-out &lt;425 &amp;&amp; y-out&gt;425) //\nmove right;</em>\n\n<em>else if(x-out&lt;125 &amp;&amp; x-out &gt;425 &amp;&amp; y-out&lt;125) //\nmove left;\nelse\nstall;</em>\n\nClasping victims/objects:\n\nClasping of objects can be done in a similar way using another accelerometer using the ADC values of any one of the axis.\nwe used a servo operated gripper for gripping the objects.\nLet the accelerometer be placed on the inside ot the palm being perpendicular to the ground as shown.\n\n<img alt="" src="http://www.robotix.in/Images/Tuts/Minefield/image04.jpg" />\n\nFig: Orientation 1\n\n<img alt="" src="http://www.robotix.in/Images/Tuts/Minefield/image00.jpg" />\nFig: Orientation 2\n\nLet the ADC values of the reference axis pins be 50-150 (For Orientation 1) and 300-400(For Orientation 2).\nNow a simple code can be used to operate the gripper corresponding to the values of the the output pin of the reference axis.\n\nPseudo Code:\n\n<em>if (out&gt;50 &amp;&amp; out&lt;150)\nservo position X Deg; //position of servo corresponding to gripper open\nelse if (out&gt;300 &amp;&amp; out&lt;400)\nservo position Y deg; //position of servo corresponding to gripper closed</em>\n\nMetal Detection:\n\nA more interesting and challenging part of this event is mine detection, which is analogous to metal detection.\nThere are two main techniques for metal detection-\n<ul>\n\t<li>Beat-frequency oscillation (BFO)</li>\n\t<li>Very low frequency (VLF)</li>\n\t<li>Pulse induction (PI)</li>\n</ul>\nFor getting an insight into how these methods work you can visit this <a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/other-gadgets/metal-detector1.htm">link</a>.\n\nFor our testing we used a BFO metal detector.\nCIRCUIT DIAGRAM:\n\n<img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/9BJKfidRQ1SpOLex1XPS0o053xTRx5H9JVZCDwCApsfbxScU1952NMMAEvxYIg0nU-7R3r4_APEf3PJ1SR1C0W7majZDnF0c7if-8tXZ-xN4Njm8RQbmWSxaW40pqXfcag" width="960" height="443" />\nCOMPONENTS:\n\n<img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fUYrBGkW9x5kthRUxxqFhYERiTFqWJKRXgX2INCznDa06OMnudt-zXqd3yqPTqae9r4CH-iLxo9LIg-iMrXvfP0AlXP70UZLGr6L4nNp_cubEeNgKru2Mynv--gHpq1XOQ" />\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="footer">\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DIY.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1460" alt="DIY" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DIY-724x1024.jpg" width="724" height="1024" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DIY-Back.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1463" alt="DIY Back" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DIY-Back-724x1024.jpg" width="724" height="1024" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CECP3yWKSo&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLzio60ZRzGwZmI8WDMXtylcg4KYOohmP9"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;">Event Video </span>Tutorial</a>.\n\nEvent Details can be found <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;"><a href="http://www.robotix.in/minefield">here</a>.</span>\nTutorial can also be found <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;"><a href="http://www.robotix.in/tutorials/categ/eventtutes/minefield">here</a>.</span>\nPictorial Do It Yourself Tutorial (DIY) is <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;"><a href="http://www.robotix.in/Images/DIYminefield.pdf">here</a>.</span>\nFacebook Discussion Group for any doubts and queries is <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/minefieldevent/">here</a>.</span>\nRegister now for the event <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;"><a href="http://www.ktj.in/events/minefield">here</a>.\n</span>\n\n</div>	t	t	t	0	0	0	Minefield Tutorial Problem statement: Build a semi-autonomous robot capable of detecting hidden metal mines autonomously and rescuing stranded victims using gesture recognition in a minefield.

After a year full of workshops, publicity, tutorials, the time for the finale had arrived. The annual techno-management fest, Kshitij 2015 was just about to unfold and with it the presence of the 15th edition of the annual robotics extravaganza, Robotix 2015, was palpable like a scent in the air.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">The fest has accumulated fame and name over the years, and had to live up to the standards set sky high by previous editions. And as everyone around the campus hoped, the standards were at par. Robotix 2015, primarily targeted at undergraduate college students of various technical colleges around India, consisted of six events, categorized into manual robotics, autonomous robotics, computer vision and coding based.</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/in1pBT3jSrhEPVetQS7QCNfgFjdyYiYVxK13JBGlux_KdM8qoRxduwdyBC8DWc5aE3p0O2ZupvkwLpab_SW2wlbKJwjZQ5WpNiEV1RiqS1XAtE7tEnQqPJBt6VbIjiKp5fkLPGs" width="200px;" height="200px;" /><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3QvGBOMiCyqYcvcGrg653pwHr15wm6du4bwASa2Kyhy2txX_hcbsET5c6BIuXvWyxi0z-80-hXNMT5ObOKmn0MQA6j1gj3HyFlbPBJ8G3d4E_hivcYlouNWQ0hwj2VEiqhWlkrU" width="200px;" height="200px;" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">To no one’s surprise, the two manual events, namely Cascade and Skyfall experienced high footfall, with total registrations exceeding 300 teams. The former required a robot to traverse down vertical pipes while shooting terrorists, while the latter was a zipline traversal and gripping-picking based event. Cascade was an event to behold with innovative bots stealing the show and often leading to very tough competitions.

With combined participation of about 150 teams, the competition was not going to be easy at all. Minefield, the Semi-Autonomous event required participants to control their bot sans any kind of buttons, but using gestures of their hands, while detecting metallic mines and saving victims. Despite the challenging problem statement the event garnered more than 100 participant teams and amazing new mechanisms were witnessed. The other autonomous event, StepUp was a completely autonomous grid following event in which bots had to traverse the grid while sorting blocks according to their heights. The challenge, albeit difficult, was tackled by some really nice codes and algorithms.</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dhRzyqtAnCwZYvBzOZiYdb0p8xWCz1f32Yh928x-ce5CCwKtkpGsnsqJwGs1TR8I1C96he3Yv0P6ToOmMjrPHqwUWM13KIY0IU4tcN3S7DamCWmnLXnOiogdTgUbxMdWo5O1q5k" width="378px;" height="378px;" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">AugHit, the computer vision event required bots to play a game of break bricks using feed of the arena given to it, processing the feed while moving in a real arena.

And in this particular case, there’s so much cool stuff going on with this NASA-funded robotic project that we couldn’t even stuff it all in to a single line. It’s a concept for a soft robotic eel designed to explore the oceans of Europa (a moon of Jupiter), which is able to scavenge electrical energy from magnetic fields, use it to generate oxygen and hydrogen, and then light it off to create an explosion to propel itself. Oh, and it’ll have a soft flexible skin that doubles as “a stretchable, electroluminescent display,” because it’s awesome. And why not.\n\nThis concept for a “soft-robotic rover with electrodynamic power scavenging” comes from Cornell University, and NASA has awarded it a grant under the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program to hoist itself up from TRL 1 to TRL 2. TRLs are “tech readiness levels;” TRL 1 is “basic principles observed and reported” while TRL 2 is “technology concept and/or application formulated.” An actual mission to Europa would involve a system that’s waaay up at TRL 9, so we’ve got a ways to go, but the sheer distance from any sort of practical technological readiness sure does let this robotic eel get away with all kinds of craziness.\n\nHere’s the overview, from the NIAC website:\n<blockquote>We propose a rover architecture for Europa and other planetary environments where soft robotics enables scientific investigation or human-precursor missions that cannot be accomplished with solar or nuclear power. This rover resembles a squid, with tentacle-like structures that serve both as electrodynamic tethers to harvest power from locally changing magnetic fields and as a means of bio-inspired propulsion. The electrical energy scavenged from the environment powers all rover subsystems, including one that electrolyzes H20. Electrolysis produces a mixture of H2 and O2 gas, which is stored internally in the body and limbs of this rover. Igniting this gas expands these internal chambers, causing shape change to propel the rover through fluid or perhaps along the surface of a planetary body.</blockquote>\nThe problem with solar power is that it’s hard to harvest efficiently as far out in the solar system as Jupiter, and impossible to harvest at all underneath an ice-covered ocean like the one that we think we might find on Europa. Nuclear would be a viable option, except that NASA has postponed or canceled much of the research on small nuclear power sources for interplanetary exploration missions.\n\nWhat the Cornell University researchers are instead suggesting is a method of harvesting energy from the powerful magnetic fields that are created by, and around, Jupiter. The idea is that these dynamic magnetic fields will generate flux throughout the conductive water column in Europa’s oceans, and that by extending an electrodynamic tether out some distance (likely a few meters) from the robot, you could harvest enough electricity to power all of the robot’s systems.\nimg\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eel_rover_2-1431327392203.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1508" alt="eel_rover_2-1431327392203" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eel_rover_2-1431327392203.jpg" width="620" height="348" /></a>\n\nInstead of using this electricity to power little propellers or something, the robot would instead take a much more robust and bio-inspired approach. The electricity gets used to electrolyze water, splitting the H2O into H2 and O2, which get stored internally in the body and limbs of the robot. The gases can then be mixed and ignited on demand, which could propel the bot in one of two ways: the explosions could either cause the limbs and body of the bot to expand and contract, allowing it to “swim,” or you could use the explosions much more directly, directing the exhaust out the back of the robot, causing it to jet forward like an octopus.\nimg\n<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eel_rover_3-1431327410372.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1509" alt="eel_rover_3-1431327410372" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eel_rover_3-1431327410372.jpg" width="620" height="351" /></a>\n\nThe last little cool bit is that “the skin of the robot will be a stretchable, electroluminescent display for illuminating the local marine environment, to enable underwater imaging.” Sure!\n\nAs a concept currently at TRL 1, we’re not expecting to see a prototype of an interplanetary robotic exploration eel for a very long time. But, that’s not to say that it isn’t a plausible design: soft robots (even soft robot octopuses) are already at the prototype stage, as are explosively-powered soft robots. Really, if you consider this robot as simply a fusion of existing technologies, it’s a lot closer to readiness than it might seem.	t	t	t	0	0	0	Sometimes, headlines just write themselves.

173	New control algorithm lets quadcopters keep flying on three or less propellers	new-control-algorithm-lets-quadcopters-keep-flying-on-three-or-less-propellers	2	\N	\N	2015-06-14 18:06:13+05:30	2015-06-24 12:47:41.688977+05:30	<div id="first_paragraph">\n\nWhether it's for Amazon-purchased goods, text books or defibrillators, unmanned multicopters are increasingly being considered for use as delivery vehicles. Given that this would involve their flying over heavily-populated areas, however, many people are rightly concerned about the aircraft malfunctioning and crashing down onto someone below. That's why researchers at ETH Zurich have created a control algorithm that allows any quadcopter to keep flying, even if it loses multiple motors or propellers.\n\n[caption id="attachment_1518" align="aligncenter" width="717"]<a href="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/broken.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1518 " alt="The New Algorithm would allow for successful Tri-Copters" src="http://robotix.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/broken-1024x680.jpg" width="717" height="476" /></a> The New Algorithm would allow for successful Tri-Copters[/caption]\n\n</div>\n<div> Because of the risk of crashes, most of the currently-proposed delivery drones are hexa- or octocopters. With their six or eight motors/propellers, they're already able to remain airborne if one of those should konk out. With all of that extra hardware, however, they're also larger, heavier, more complex, and thus less efficient than quadcopters.</div>\nThe ETH algorithm can be added to the control system of existing quadcopters, and requires no physical changes or additions to the aircraft.\n\nWhen the software detects that one or more of the propellers has stopped working – either because it's come off, or due to motor failure – it initially uses the remaining props to put the drone in a hovering horizontal spin. Then, by selectively altering the thrust of each propeller, it steers the quadcopter by tilting the angle of its rotation, and eases it down to a controlled landing.\n\nThe algorithm reportedly works even if only <em>one</em> prop is operational. A quadcopter using the technology to land on three propellers can be seen in the video below.\n\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bsHryqnvyYA" height="300" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n\nSource: <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2013/12/new-algorithm-makes-quadrocopters-safer.html" target="_blank">ETH Zurich</a>	t	t	t	0	0	0	Whether it's for Amazon-purchased goods, text books or defibrillators, unmanned multicopters are increasingly being considered for use as delivery vehicles.
